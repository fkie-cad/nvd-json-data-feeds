      "value": "Novu provides an API for sending notifications through multiple channels. Versions prior to 0.16.0 contain an open redirect vulnerability in the \"Sign In with GitHub\" functionality of Novu's open-source repository. It could have allowed an attacker to force a victim into opening a malicious URL and thus, potentially log into the repository under the victim's account gaining full control of the account. This vulnerability only affected the Novu Cloud and Open-Source deployments if the user manually enabled the GitHub OAuth on their self-hosted instance of Novu. Users should upgrade to version 0.16.0 to receive a patch."
