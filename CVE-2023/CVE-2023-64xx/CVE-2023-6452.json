It has \nbeen determined that the \"user agent\" field in the Transaction Viewer is\n vulnerable to a persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, \nwhich can be exploited by any user who can route traffic through the \nForcepoint Web proxy.\n\nThis \nvulnerability enables unauthorized attackers to execute JavaScript \nwithin the browser context of a Forcepoint administrator, thereby \nallowing them to perform actions on the administrator's behalf. Such a \nbreach could lead to unauthorized access or modifications, posing a \nsignificant security risk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis issue affects Web Security: before 8.5.6."
