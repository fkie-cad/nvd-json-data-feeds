      "value": "The Depicter Slider \u2013 Responsive Image Slider, Video Slider & Post Slider plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.6. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'save' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. CVE-2023-51491 appears to be a duplicate of this issue."
