(Note that these paths were also modified by\na second broken error handling patch which in effect cancelled out this\npart when merged.)\n\nSecond, the newly added allocation sanity check would still leak the\npreviously allocated drm device.\n\nInstead of trying to salvage what was badly broken (and clearly not\ntested), let's revert the bad commit so that clean and backportable\nfixes can be added in its place.\n\nPatchwork: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/525107/"
