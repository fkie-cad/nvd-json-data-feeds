      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nSUNRPC: double free xprt_ctxt while still in use\n\nWhen an RPC request is deferred, the rq_xprt_ctxt pointer is moved out\nof the svc_rqst into the svc_deferred_req.\nWhen the deferred request is revisited, the pointer is copied into\nthe new svc_rqst - and also remains in the svc_deferred_req.\n\nIn the (rare?) case that the request is deferred a second time, the old\nsvc_deferred_req is reused - it still has all the correct content.\nHowever in that case the rq_xprt_ctxt pointer is NOT cleared so that\nwhen xpo_release_xprt is called, the ctxt is freed (UDP) or possible\nadded to a free list (RDMA).\nWhen the deferred request is revisited for a second time, it will\nreference this ctxt which may be invalid, and the free the object a\nsecond time which is likely to oops.\n\nSo change svc_defer() to *always* clear rq_xprt_ctxt, and assert that\nthe value is now stored in the svc_deferred_req."
