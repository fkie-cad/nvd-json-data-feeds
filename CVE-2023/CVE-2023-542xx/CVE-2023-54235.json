This creates a race between\ndestroy_work_on_stack() and the task->work struct going out of scope in\npci_doe().\n\nSignal the work complete after destroying the work struct.  This is safe\nbecause signal_task_complete() is the final thing the work item does and\nthe workqueue code is careful not to access the work struct after."
