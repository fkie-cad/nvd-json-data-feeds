      "value": "A certain software build for the Orbic Maui device (Orbic/RC545L/RC545L:10/ORB545L_V1.4.2_BVZPP/230106:user/release-keys) leaks the IMEI and the ICCID to system properties that can be accessed by any local app on the device without any permissions or special privileges. Google restricted third-party apps from directly obtaining non-resettable device identifiers in Android 10 and higher, but in this instance they are leaked by a high-privilege process and can be obtained indirectly. This malicious app reads from the \"persist.sys.verizon_test_plan_imei\" system property to indirectly obtain the IMEI and reads the \"persist.sys.verizon_test_plan_iccid\" system property to obtain the ICCID."
