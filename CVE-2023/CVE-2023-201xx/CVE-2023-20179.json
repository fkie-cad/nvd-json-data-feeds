      "value": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager, formerly Cisco SD-WAN vManage, could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to inject HTML content.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied data in element fields. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting malicious content within requests and persuading a user to view a page that contains injected content. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to modify pages within the web-based management interface, possibly leading to further browser-based attacks against users of the application."
