This sort field is sent from the front-end to the back-end, and the SQL query is generated using this field. However, because this sort field isn't validated, there is a risk of SQL injection vulnerability.\u00a0The attacker must successfully log into the system to launch an attack, which may cause data leakage. Since no data will be written, so this is a low-impact vulnerability.\n\nMitigation:\n\nall users should upgrade to 2.1.4,  Such parameters will be blocked.\n\n"
