      "value": "Paessler PRTG Network Monitor Cross-Site Scripting Authentication Bypass Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to bypass authentication on affected installations of Paessler PRTG Network Monitor. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the web console. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can lead to the injection of an arbitrary script. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to bypass authentication on the system.\n. Was ZDI-CAN-21182."
