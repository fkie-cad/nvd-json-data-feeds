      "value": "Mikrotik RouterOS RADVD Out-Of-Bounds Write Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Mikrotik RouterOS. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the Router Advertisement Daemon. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a write past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-19797."
