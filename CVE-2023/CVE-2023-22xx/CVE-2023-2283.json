      "value": "A vulnerability was found in libssh, where the authentication check of the connecting client can be bypassed in the`pki_verify_data_signature` function in memory allocation problems. This issue may happen if there is insufficient memory or the memory usage is limited. The problem is caused by the return value `rc,` which is initialized to SSH_ERROR and later rewritten to save the return value of the function call `pki_key_check_hash_compatible.` The value of the variable is not changed between this point and the cryptographic verification. Therefore any error between them calls `goto error` returning SSH_OK."
