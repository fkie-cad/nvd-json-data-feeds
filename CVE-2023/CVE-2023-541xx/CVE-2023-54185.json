However there's\nno need to have these BUG_ON()'s, we can just return any error to the\ncaller and all callers and their upper call chain are already dealing with\nerrors.\n\nSo just make add_new_free_space() return any errors, while removing the\nBUG_ON()'s, and returning the total amount of added free space to an\noptional u64 pointer argument."
