We do that for the content of the 'issued' and 'submitted' lists,\nbut the 'current_tx' descriptor falls through the cracks as it's\nremoved from the 'issued' list once it gets assigned to be the current\ndescriptor. Explicitly queue up freeing of the 'current_tx' descriptor\nto address a memory leak that is otherwise present."
