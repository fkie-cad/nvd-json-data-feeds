      "value": "The Intuitive Custom Post Order plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection in versions up to, and including, 3.1.3, due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied 'objects' and 'tags' parameters and lack of sufficient preparation in the 'update_options' function as well as the 'refresh' function which runs queries on the same values. This allows authenticated attackers, with administrator permissions, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. Note that this attack may only be practical on configurations where it is possible to bypass addslashes due to the database using a nonstandard character set such as GBK."
