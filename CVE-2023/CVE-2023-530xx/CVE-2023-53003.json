But when\nit is passed as the private driver info to the EDAC core, it will get freed\nduring the qcom_edac driver release. So when the qcom_edac driver gets probed\nagain, it will try to use the freed data leading to the use-after-free bug.\n\nHence, do not pass llcc_driv_data as pvt_info but rather reference it\nusing the platform_data pointer in the qcom_edac driver."
