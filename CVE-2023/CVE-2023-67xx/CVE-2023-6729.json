      "value": "Nokia SR OS routers allow read-write access to the entire file system via SFTP or SCP for users configured with \"access console.\" Consequently, a low privilege authenticated user with \"access console\" can read or replace the router configuration file as well as other files stored in the Compact Flash or SD card without using CLI commands. This type of attack can lead to a compromise or denial of service of the router after the system is rebooted."
