      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmlx5: fix possible ptp queue fifo use-after-free\n\nFifo indexes are not checked during pop operations and it leads to\npotential use-after-free when poping from empty queue. Such case was\npossible during re-sync action. WARN_ON_ONCE covers future cases.\n\nThere were out-of-order cqe spotted which lead to drain of the queue and\nuse-after-free because of lack of fifo pointers check. Special check and\ncounter are added to avoid resync operation if SKB could not exist in the\nfifo because of OOO cqe (skb_id must be between consumer and producer\nindex)."
