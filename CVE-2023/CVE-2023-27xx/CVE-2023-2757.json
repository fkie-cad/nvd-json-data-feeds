      "value": "The Waiting: One-click countdowns plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on 'saveLang' functions in versions up to, and including, 0.6.2. This could lead to Cross-Site Scripting due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for subscriber-level attackers to access functions to save plugin data that can potentially lead to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page."
