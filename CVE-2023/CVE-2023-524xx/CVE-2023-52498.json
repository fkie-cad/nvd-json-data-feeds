      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nPM: sleep: Fix possible deadlocks in core system-wide PM code\n\nIt is reported that in low-memory situations the system-wide resume core\ncode deadlocks, because async_schedule_dev() executes its argument\nfunction synchronously if it cannot allocate memory (and not only in\nthat case) and that function attempts to acquire a mutex that is already\nheld.  Executing the argument function synchronously from within\ndpm_async_fn() may also be problematic for ordering reasons (it may\ncause a consumer device's resume callback to be invoked before a\nrequisite supplier device's one, for example).\n\nAddress this by changing the code in question to use\nasync_schedule_dev_nocall() for scheduling the asynchronous\nexecution of device suspend and resume functions and to directly\nrun them synchronously if async_schedule_dev_nocall() returns false."
