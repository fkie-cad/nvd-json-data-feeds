      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\naccel/qaic: Clean up integer overflow checking in map_user_pages()\n\nThe encode_dma() function has some validation on in_trans->size but it\nwould be more clear to move those checks to find_and_map_user_pages().\n\nThe encode_dma() had two checks:\n\n\tif (in_trans->addr + in_trans->size < in_trans->addr || !in_trans->size)\n\t\treturn -EINVAL;\n\nThe in_trans->addr variable is the starting address.  The in_trans->size\nvariable is the total size of the transfer.  The transfer can occur in\nparts and the resources->xferred_dma_size tracks how many bytes we have\nalready transferred.\n\nThis patch introduces a new variable \"remaining\" which represents the\namount we want to transfer (in_trans->size) minus the amount we have\nalready transferred (resources->xferred_dma_size).\n\nI have modified the check for if in_trans->size is zero to instead check\nif in_trans->size is less than resources->xferred_dma_size.  If we have\nalready transferred more bytes than in_trans->size then there are negative\nbytes remaining which doesn't make sense.  If there are zero bytes\nremaining to be copied, just return success.\n\nThe check in encode_dma() checked that \"addr + size\" could not overflow\nand barring a driver bug that should work, but it's easier to check if\nwe do this in parts.  First check that \"in_trans->addr +\nresources->xferred_dma_size\" is safe.  Then check that \"xfer_start_addr +\nremaining\" is safe.\n\nMy final concern was that we are dealing with u64 values but on 32bit\nsystems the kmalloc() function will truncate the sizes to 32 bits.  So\nI calculated \"total = in_trans->size + offset_in_page(xfer_start_addr);\"\nand returned -EINVAL if it were >= SIZE_MAX.  This will not affect 64bit\nsystems."
