      "value": "The Unlimited Addons for WPBakery Page Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to insufficient file type validation on the 'importZipFile' function in versions up to, and including, 1.0.42. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with a role that the administrator previously granted access to the plugin (the default is editor role, but access can also be granted to contributor role), to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible."
