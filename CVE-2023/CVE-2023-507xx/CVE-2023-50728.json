Starting in 9.26.0 and prior to 9.26.3, 10.9.2, 11.1.2, and 12.0.4, there is a problem caused by an issue with error handling in the @octokit/webhooks library because the error can be undefined in some cases. The resulting request was found to cause an uncaught exception that ends the nodejs process.  The bug is fixed in octokit/webhooks.js 9.26.3, 10.9.2, 11.1.2, and 12.0.4, app.js 14.02, octokit.js 3.1.2, and Protobot 12.3.3."
