      "value": "Summary of Vulnerability\r\nA template injection vulnerability on older versions of Confluence Data Center and Server allows an unauthenticated attacker to achieve RCE on an affected instance. Customers using an affected version must take immediate action.\r\n\r\nMost recent supported versions of Confluence Data Center and Server are not affected by this vulnerability as it was ultimately mitigated during regular version updates. However, Atlassian recommends that customers take care to install the latest version to protect their instances from non-critical vulnerabilities outlined in Atlassian\u2019s January Security Bulletin.\r\n\r\nSee \u201cWhat You Need to Do\u201d for detailed instructions.\r\n \r\n{panel:bgColor=#deebff}\r\nAtlassian Cloud sites are not affected by this vulnerability.
