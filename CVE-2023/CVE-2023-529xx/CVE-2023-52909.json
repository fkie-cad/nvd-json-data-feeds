      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnfsd: fix handling of cached open files in nfsd4_open codepath\n\nCommit fb70bf124b05 (\"NFSD: Instantiate a struct file when creating a\nregular NFSv4 file\") added the ability to cache an open fd over a\ncompound. There are a couple of problems with the way this currently\nworks:\n\nIt's racy, as a newly-created nfsd_file can end up with its PENDING bit\ncleared while the nf is hashed, and the nf_file pointer is still zeroed\nout. Other tasks can find it in this state and they expect to see a\nvalid nf_file, and can oops if nf_file is NULL.\n\nAlso, there is no guarantee that we'll end up creating a new nfsd_file\nif one is already in the hash. If an extant entry is in the hash with a\nvalid nf_file, nfs4_get_vfs_file will clobber its nf_file pointer with\nthe value of op_file and the old nf_file will leak.\n\nFix both issues by making a new nfsd_file_acquirei_opened variant that\ntakes an optional file pointer. If one is present when this is called,\nwe'll take a new reference to it instead of trying to open the file. If\nthe nfsd_file already has a valid nf_file, we'll just ignore the\noptional file and pass the nfsd_file back as-is.\n\nAlso rework the tracepoints a bit to allow for an \"opened\" variant and\ndon't try to avoid counting acquisitions in the case where we already\nhave a cached open file."
