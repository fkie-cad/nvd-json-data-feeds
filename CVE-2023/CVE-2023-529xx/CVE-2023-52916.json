Use 1600x900 to display on host\n2. Mount ISO through 'Virtual media' on OpenBMC's web\n3. Run script as below on host to do sha continuously\n  #!/bin/bash\n  while [ [1] ];\n  do\n\tfind /media -type f -printf '\"%h/%f\"\\n' | xargs sha256sum\n  done\n4. Open KVM on OpenBMC's web\n\nThe size of macro block captured is 8x8. Therefore, we should make sure\nthe height of src-buf is 8 aligned to fix this issue."
