      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: ath12k: Fix memory leak in rx_desc and tx_desc\n\nCurrently when ath12k_dp_cc_desc_init() is called we allocate\nmemory to rx_descs and tx_descs. In ath12k_dp_cc_cleanup(), during\ndescriptor cleanup rx_descs and tx_descs memory is not freed.\n\nThis is cause of memory leak. These allocated memory should be\nfreed in ath12k_dp_cc_cleanup.\n\nIn ath12k_dp_cc_desc_init(), we can save base address of rx_descs\nand tx_descs. In ath12k_dp_cc_cleanup(), we can free rx_descs and\ntx_descs memory using their base address.\n\nTested-on: QCN9274 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.WBE.1.0.1-00029-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1"
