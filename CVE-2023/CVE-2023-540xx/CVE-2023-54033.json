      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: fix a memory leak in the LRU and LRU_PERCPU hash maps\n\nThe LRU and LRU_PERCPU maps allocate a new element on update before locking the\ntarget hash table bucket. Right after that the maps try to lock the bucket.\nIf this fails, then maps return -EBUSY to the caller without releasing the\nallocated element. This makes the element untracked: it doesn't belong to\neither of free lists, and it doesn't belong to the hash table, so can't be\nre-used; this eventually leads to the permanent -ENOMEM on LRU map updates,\nwhich is unexpected. Fix this by returning the element to the local free list\nif bucket locking fails."
