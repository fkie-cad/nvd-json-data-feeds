This hunk is some missed leftover from rework. Adding it\ntwice will corrupt the linked list in some cases.\n\nIt effects HWPT specific attachment, which is something the test suite\ncannot cover until we can create a legitimate struct device with a\nnon-system iommu \"driver\" (ie we need the bus removed from the iommu code)"
