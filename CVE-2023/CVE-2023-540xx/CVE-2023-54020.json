This logic\nwas removed in commit b2cc5c465c2c (\"dmaengine: sf-pdma: Add multithread\nsupport for a DMA channel\"), but sf_pdma_free_desc() was not changed to\nhandle the new behaviour.\n\nAs a result, each time sf_pdma_prep_dma_memcpy() is called, the previous\ndescriptor is leaked, over time leading to memory starvation:\n\n  unreferenced object 0xffffffe008447300 (size 192):\n  comm \"irq/39-mchp_dsc\", pid 343, jiffies 4294906910 (age 981.200s)\n  hex dump (first 32 bytes):\n    00 00 00 ff 00 00 00 00 b8 c1 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................\n    00 00 70 08 10 00 00 00 00 00 00 c0 00 00 00 00  ..p.............\n  backtrace:\n    [<00000000064a04f4>] kmemleak_alloc+0x1e/0x28\n    [<00000000018927a7>] kmem_cache_alloc+0x11e/0x178\n    [<000000002aea8d16>] sf_pdma_prep_dma_memcpy+0x40/0x112\n\nAdd the missing kfree() to sf_pdma_free_desc(), and remove the redundant\nin_use flag."
