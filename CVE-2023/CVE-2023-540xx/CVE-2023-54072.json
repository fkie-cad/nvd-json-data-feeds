      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nALSA: pcm: Fix potential data race at PCM memory allocation helpers\n\nThe PCM memory allocation helpers have a sanity check against too many\nbuffer allocations.  However, the check is performed without a proper\nlock and the allocation isn't serialized; this allows user to allocate\nmore memories than predefined max size.\n\nPractically seen, this isn't really a big problem, as it's more or\nless some \"soft limit\" as a sanity check, and it's not possible to\nallocate unlimitedly.  But it's still better to address this for more\nconsistent behavior.\n\nThe patch covers the size check in do_alloc_pages() with the\ncard->memory_mutex, and increases the allocated size there for\npreventing the further overflow.  When the actual allocation fails,\nthe size is decreased accordingly."
