It permits multiple transactions with the same connectorId and idTag, contrary to the expected ConcurrentTx status. This could result in critical transaction management and billing errors. NOTE: the vendor's perspective is \"Imagine you've got two cars in your family and want to charge both in parallel on the same account/token? Why should that be rejected?\""
