      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nblock/rq_qos: protect rq_qos apis with a new lock\n\ncommit 50e34d78815e (\"block: disable the elevator int del_gendisk\")\nmove rq_qos_exit() from disk_release() to del_gendisk(), this will\nintroduce some problems:\n\n1) If rq_qos_add() is triggered by enabling iocost/iolatency through\n   cgroupfs, then it can concurrent with del_gendisk(), it's not safe to\n   write 'q->rq_qos' concurrently.\n\n2) Activate cgroup policy that is relied on rq_qos will call\n   rq_qos_add() and blkcg_activate_policy(), and if rq_qos_exit() is\n   called in the middle, null-ptr-dereference will be triggered in\n   blkcg_activate_policy().\n\n3) blkg_conf_open_bdev() can call blkdev_get_no_open() first to find the\n   disk, then if rq_qos_exit() from del_gendisk() is done before\n   rq_qos_add(), then memory will be leaked.\n\nThis patch add a new disk level mutex 'rq_qos_mutex':\n\n1) The lock will protect rq_qos_exit() directly.\n\n2) For wbt that doesn't relied on blk-cgroup, rq_qos_add() can only be\n   called from disk initialization for now because wbt can't be\n   destructed until rq_qos_exit(), so it's safe not to protect wbt for\n   now. Hoever, in case that rq_qos dynamically destruction is supported\n   in the furture, this patch also protect rq_qos_add() from wbt_init()\n   directly, this is enough because blk-sysfs already synchronize\n   writers with disk removal.\n\n3) For iocost and iolatency, in order to synchronize disk removal and\n   cgroup configuration, the lock is held after blkdev_get_no_open()\n   from blkg_conf_open_bdev(), and is released in blkg_conf_exit().\n   In order to fix the above memory leak, disk_live() is checked after\n   holding the new lock."
