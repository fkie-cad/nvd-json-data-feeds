      "value": "Vite is a website frontend framework. When Vite's HTML transformation is invoked manually via `server.transformIndexHtml`, the original request URL is passed in unmodified, and the `html` being transformed contains inline module scripts (`<script type=\"module\">...</script>`), it is possible to inject arbitrary HTML into the transformed output by supplying a malicious URL query string to `server.transformIndexHtml`. Only apps using `appType: 'custom'` and using the default Vite HTML middleware are affected. The HTML entry must also contain an inline script. The attack requires a user to click on a malicious URL while running the dev server. Restricted files aren't exposed to the attacker. This issue has been addressed in vite@5.0.5, vite@4.5.1, and vite@4.4.12. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."
