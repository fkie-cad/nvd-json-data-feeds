      "value": "dpaste is an open source pastebin application written in Python using the Django framework. A security vulnerability has been identified in the expires parameter of the dpaste API, allowing for a POST Reflected XSS attack. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data theft, or other malicious activities.
