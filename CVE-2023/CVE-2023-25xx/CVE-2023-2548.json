      "value": "The RegistrationMagic plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object References in versions up to, and including, 5.2.0.5. This is due to the plugin providing user-controlled access to objects, letting a user bypass authorization and access system resources. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to change user passwords and potentially take over super-administrator accounts in multisite setup."
