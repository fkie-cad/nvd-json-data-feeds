A user can request a web proxy and obtain a URL in the Remote Management System cloud subdomain. This URL could be shared with others without Remote Management System authentication . An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to create a malicious webpage that uses a trusted and certified domain. An attacker could initiate a reverse shell when a victim connects to the malicious webpage, achieving remote code execution on the victim device.\n\n"
