      "value": "\nAn Improper Privilege Management vulnerability in Trellix GetSusp prior to version 5.0.0.27 allows a local, low privilege attacker to gain access to files that usually require a higher privilege level.  This is caused by GetSusp not correctly protecting a directory that it creates during execution, allowing an attacker to take over file handles used by GetSusp. As this runs with high privileges, the attacker gains elevated permissions. The file handles are opened as read-only. \n\n"
