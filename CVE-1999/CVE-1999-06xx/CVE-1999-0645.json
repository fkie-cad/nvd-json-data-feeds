  "evaluatorSolution": "IRC Service is an unsecured protocol that typically does not authenticate the identity of users and does not encrypt its network communications.  IRC is not commonly deployed on enterprise networks.  If an organization decides to use it, it should be patched and configured properly, otherwise it should be disabled.",
  "evaluatorImpact": "This Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) entry is a configuration issue and not a software flaw. As such, it doesn\u2019t fit in the CVE software flaw list. The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score for this CVE entry has been set to 0 because this CVE entry has no impact as a software flaw according to CVSS. This does not mean that the configuration issue is not important and there may be security implications relative to computers having this configuration.",

      "value": "Rejected reason: DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER.  ConsultIDs: None.  Reason: this candidate is solely about a configuration that does not directly introduce security vulnerabilities, so it is more appropriate to cover under the Common Configuration Enumeration (CCE).  Notes: the former description is: \"The IRC service is running."
