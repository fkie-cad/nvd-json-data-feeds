      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbinder: fix UAF of ref->proc caused by race condition\n\nA transaction of type BINDER_TYPE_WEAK_HANDLE can fail to increment the\nreference for a node. In this case, the target proc normally releases\nthe failed reference upon close as expected. However, if the target is\ndying in parallel the call will race with binder_deferred_release(), so\nthe target could have released all of its references by now leaving the\ncleanup of the new failed reference unhandled.\n\nThe transaction then ends and the target proc gets released making the\nref->proc now a dangling pointer. Later on, ref->node is closed and we\nattempt to take spin_lock(&ref->proc->inner_lock), which leads to the\nuse-after-free bug reported below. Let's fix this by cleaning up the\nfailed reference on the spot instead of relying on the target to do so.\n\n  ==================================================================\n  BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in _raw_spin_lock+0xa8/0x150\n  Write of size 4 at addr ffff5ca207094238 by task kworker/1:0/590\n\n  CPU: 1 PID: 590 Comm: kworker/1:0 Not tainted 5.19.0-rc8 #10\n  Hardware name: linux,dummy-virt (DT)\n  Workqueue: events binder_deferred_func\n  Call trace:\n   dump_backtrace.part.0+0x1d0/0x1e0\n   show_stack+0x18/0x70\n   dump_stack_lvl+0x68/0x84\n   print_report+0x2e4/0x61c\n   kasan_report+0xa4/0x110\n   kasan_check_range+0xfc/0x1a4\n   __kasan_check_write+0x3c/0x50\n   _raw_spin_lock+0xa8/0x150\n   binder_deferred_func+0x5e0/0x9b0\n   process_one_work+0x38c/0x5f0\n   worker_thread+0x9c/0x694\n   kthread+0x188/0x190\n   ret_from_fork+0x10/0x20"
