As far as I can tell, there's no reason for the mutex to be\nheld while the gadget core calls a gadget driver's ->bind or ->unbind\nroutine, or while a UDC is being started or stopped.  (This accounts\nfor link #1 in the chain above, where the mutex is held while the\ndwc2_hsotg_udc is started as part of driver probing.)\n\nGadget drivers' ->disconnect callbacks are problematic.  Even though\nusb_gadget_disconnect() will now acquire the udc_mutex, there's a\nwindow in usb_gadget_bind_driver() between the times when the mutex is\nreleased and the ->bind callback is invoked.  If a disconnect occurred\nduring that window, we could call the driver's ->disconnect routine\nbefore its ->bind routine.  To prevent this from happening, it will be\nnecessary to prevent a UDC from connecting while it has no gadget\ndriver.  This should be done already but it doesn't seem to be;\ncurrently usb_gadget_connect() has no check for this.  Such a check\nwill have to be added later.\n\nSome degree of mutual exclusion is required in soft_connect_store(),\nwhich can dereference udc->driver at arbitrary times since it is a\nsysfs callback.  The solution here is to acquire the gadget's device\nlock rather than the udc_mutex.  Since the driver core guarantees that\nthe device lock is always held during driver binding and unbinding,\nthis will make the accesses in soft_connect_store() mutually exclusive\nwith any changes to udc->driver.\n\nLastly, it turns out there is one place which should hold the\nudc_mutex but currently does not: The function_show() routine needs\nprotection while it dereferences udc->driver.  The missing lock and\nunlock calls are added."
