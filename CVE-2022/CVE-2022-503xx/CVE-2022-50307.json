      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ns390/cio: fix out-of-bounds access on cio_ignore free\n\nThe channel-subsystem-driver scans for newly available devices whenever\ndevice-IDs are removed from the cio_ignore list using a command such as:\n\n  echo free >/proc/cio_ignore\n\nSince an I/O device scan might interfer with running I/Os, commit\n172da89ed0ea (\"s390/cio: avoid excessive path-verification requests\")\nintroduced an optimization to exclude online devices from the scan.\n\nThe newly added check for online devices incorrectly assumes that\nan I/O-subchannel's drvdata points to a struct io_subchannel_private.\nFor devices that are bound to a non-default I/O subchannel driver, such\nas the vfio_ccw driver, this results in an out-of-bounds read access\nduring each scan.\n\nFix this by changing the scan logic to rely on a driver-independent\nonline indication. For this we can use struct subchannel->config.ena,\nwhich is the driver's requested subchannel-enabled state. Since I/Os\ncan only be started on enabled subchannels, this matches the intent\nof the original optimization of not scanning devices where I/O might\nbe running."
