      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfuse: write inode in fuse_release()\n\nA race between write(2) and close(2) allows pages to be dirtied after\nfuse_flush -> write_inode_now().  If these pages are not flushed from\nfuse_release(), then there might not be a writable open file later.  So any\nremaining dirty pages must be written back before the file is released.\n\nThis is a partial revert of the blamed commit."
