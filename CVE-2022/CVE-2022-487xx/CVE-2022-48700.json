      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvfio/type1: Unpin zero pages\n\nThere's currently a reference count leak on the zero page.  We increment\nthe reference via pin_user_pages_remote(), but the page is later handled\nas an invalid/reserved page, therefore it's not accounted against the\nuser and not unpinned by our put_pfn().\n\nIntroducing special zero page handling in put_pfn() would resolve the\nleak, but without accounting of the zero page, a single user could\nstill create enough mappings to generate a reference count overflow.\n\nThe zero page is always resident, so for our purposes there's no reason\nto keep it pinned.  Therefore, add a loop to walk pages returned from\npin_user_pages_remote() and unpin any zero pages."
