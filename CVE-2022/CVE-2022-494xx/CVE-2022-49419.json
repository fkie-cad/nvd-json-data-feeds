For example, if no\nprocess has the fbdev chardev opened by the time the driver is removed.\n\nIf that's the case, fb_info will be freed when unregister_framebuffer() is\ncalled, making the fb_info pointer accessed in vesafb_remove() after that\nto no longer be valid.\n\nTo prevent that, move the expression containing the info->par to happen\nbefore the unregister_framebuffer() function call."
