This can lead to NULL pointer dereferences in those drivers'\nDMA API calls, or worse.\n\nInstead of calling the full arm_smmu_device_remove() from\narm_smmu_device_shutdown(), let's pick only the relevant function call -\narm_smmu_device_disable() - more or less the reverse of\narm_smmu_device_reset() - and call just that from the shutdown path."
