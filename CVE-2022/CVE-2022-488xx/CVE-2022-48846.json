      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nblock: release rq qos structures for queue without disk\n\nblkcg_init_queue() may add rq qos structures to request queue, previously\nblk_cleanup_queue() calls rq_qos_exit() to release them, but commit\n8e141f9eb803 (\"block: drain file system I/O on del_gendisk\")\nmoves rq_qos_exit() into del_gendisk(), so memory leak is caused\nbecause queues may not have disk, such as un-present scsi luns, nvme\nadmin queue, ...\n\nFixes the issue by adding rq_qos_exit() to blk_cleanup_queue() back.\n\nBTW, v5.18 won't need this patch any more since we move\nblkcg_init_queue()/blkcg_exit_queue() into disk allocation/release\nhandler, and patches have been in for-5.18/block."
