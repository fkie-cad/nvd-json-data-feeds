      "value": "A vulnerability in the web-based interface of Cisco&nbsp;Webex Meetings could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based interface.\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based interface of Cisco&nbsp;Webex Meetings. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a maliciously crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability."
