      "value": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco&nbsp;ECE could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to redirect a user to an undesired web page.\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper input validation of the URL parameters in an HTTP request that is sent to an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the interface to redirect the user to a specific, malicious URL. This type of vulnerability is known as an open redirect and is used in phishing attacks that get users to unknowingly visit malicious sites.Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability."
