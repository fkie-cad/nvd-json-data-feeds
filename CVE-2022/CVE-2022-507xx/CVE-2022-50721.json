      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndmaengine: qcom-adm: fix wrong calling convention for prep_slave_sg\n\nThe calling convention for pre_slave_sg is to return NULL on error and\nprovide an error log to the system. Qcom-adm instead provide error\npointer when an error occur. This indirectly cause kernel panic for\nexample for the nandc driver that checks only if the pointer returned by\ndevice_prep_slave_sg is not NULL. Returning an error pointer makes nandc\nthink the device_prep_slave_sg function correctly completed and makes\nthe kernel panics later in the code.\n\nWhile nandc is the one that makes the kernel crash, it was pointed out\nthat the real problem is qcom-adm not following calling convention for\nthat function.\n\nTo fix this, drop returning error pointer and return NULL with an error\nlog."
