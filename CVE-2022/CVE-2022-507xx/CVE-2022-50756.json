      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnvme-pci: fix mempool alloc size\n\nConvert the max size to bytes to match the units of the divisor that\ncalculates the worst-case number of PRP entries.\n\nThe result is used to determine how many PRP Lists are required. The\ncode was previously rounding this to 1 list, but we can require 2 in the\nworst case. In that scenario, the driver would corrupt memory beyond the\nsize provided by the mempool.\n\nWhile unlikely to occur (you'd need a 4MB in exactly 127 phys segments\non a queue that doesn't support SGLs), this memory corruption has been\nobserved by kfence."
