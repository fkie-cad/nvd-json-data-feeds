      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmac80211: fix potential double free on mesh join\n\nWhile commit 6a01afcf8468 (\"mac80211: mesh: Free ie data when leaving\nmesh\") fixed a memory leak on mesh leave / teardown it introduced a\npotential memory corruption caused by a double free when rejoining the\nmesh:\n\n  ieee80211_leave_mesh()\n  -> kfree(sdata->u.mesh.ie);\n  ...\n  ieee80211_join_mesh()\n  -> copy_mesh_setup()\n     -> old_ie = ifmsh->ie;\n     -> kfree(old_ie);\n\nThis double free / kernel panics can be reproduced by using wpa_supplicant\nwith an encrypted mesh (if set up without encryption via \"iw\" then\nifmsh->ie is always NULL, which avoids this issue). And then calling:\n\n  $ iw dev mesh0 mesh leave\n  $ iw dev mesh0 mesh join my-mesh\n\nNote that typically these commands are not used / working when using\nwpa_supplicant. And it seems that wpa_supplicant or wpa_cli are going\nthrough a NETDEV_DOWN/NETDEV_UP cycle between a mesh leave and mesh join\nwhere the NETDEV_UP resets the mesh.ie to NULL via a memcpy of\ndefault_mesh_setup in cfg80211_netdev_notifier_call, which then avoids\nthe memory corruption, too.\n\nThe issue was first observed in an application which was not using\nwpa_supplicant but \"Senf\" instead, which implements its own calls to\nnl80211.\n\nFixing the issue by removing the kfree()'ing of the mesh IE in the mesh\njoin function and leaving it solely up to the mesh leave to free the\nmesh IE."
