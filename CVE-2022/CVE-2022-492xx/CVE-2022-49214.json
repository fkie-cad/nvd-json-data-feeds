      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npowerpc/64s: Don't use DSISR for SLB faults\n\nSince commit 46ddcb3950a2 (\"powerpc/mm: Show if a bad page fault on data\nis read or write.\") we use page_fault_is_write(regs->dsisr) in\n__bad_page_fault() to determine if the fault is for a read or write, and\nchange the message printed accordingly.\n\nBut SLB faults, aka Data Segment Interrupts, don't set DSISR (Data\nStorage Interrupt Status Register) to a useful value. All ISA versions\nfrom v2.03 through v3.1 specify that the Data Segment Interrupt sets\nDSISR \"to an undefined value\". As far as I can see there's no mention of\nSLB faults setting DSISR in any BookIV content either.\n\nThis manifests as accesses that should be a read being incorrectly\nreported as writes, for example, using the xmon \"dump\" command:\n\n  0:mon> d 0x5deadbeef0000000\n  5deadbeef0000000\n  [359526.415354][    C6] BUG: Unable to handle kernel data access on write at 0x5deadbeef0000000\n  [359526.415611][    C6] Faulting instruction address: 0xc00000000010a300\n  cpu 0x6: Vector: 380 (Data SLB Access) at [c00000000ffbf400]\n      pc: c00000000010a300: mread+0x90/0x190\n\nIf we disassemble the PC, we see a load instruction:\n\n  0:mon> di c00000000010a300\n  c00000000010a300 89490000      lbz     r10,0(r9)\n\nWe can also see in exceptions-64s.S that the data_access_slb block\ndoesn't set IDSISR=1, which means it doesn't load DSISR into pt_regs. So\nthe value we're using to determine if the fault is a read/write is some\nstale value in pt_regs from a previous page fault.\n\nRework the printing logic to separate the SLB fault case out, and only\nprint read/write in the cases where we can determine it.\n\nThe result looks like eg:\n\n  0:mon> d 0x5deadbeef0000000\n  5deadbeef0000000\n  [  721.779525][    C6] BUG: Unable to handle kernel data access at 0x5deadbeef0000000\n  [  721.779697][    C6] Faulting instruction address: 0xc00000000014cbe0\n  cpu 0x6: Vector: 380 (Data SLB Access) at [c00000000ffbf390]\n\n  0:mon> d 0\n  0000000000000000\n  [  742.793242][    C6] BUG: Kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0x00000000\n  [  742.793316][    C6] Faulting instruction address: 0xc00000000014cbe0\n  cpu 0x6: Vector: 380 (Data SLB Access) at [c00000000ffbf390]"
