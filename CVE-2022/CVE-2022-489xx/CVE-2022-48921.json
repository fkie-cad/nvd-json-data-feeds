      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsched/fair: Fix fault in reweight_entity\n\nSyzbot found a GPF in reweight_entity. This has been bisected to\ncommit 4ef0c5c6b5ba (\"kernel/sched: Fix sched_fork() access an invalid\nsched_task_group\")\n\nThere\u00a0is a race between sched_post_fork() and setpriority(PRIO_PGRP)\nwithin a thread group that causes a null-ptr-deref\u00a0in\nreweight_entity() in CFS. The scenario is that the main process spawns\nnumber of new threads, which then call setpriority(PRIO_PGRP, 0, -20),\nwait, and exit.  For each of the new threads the copy_process() gets\ninvoked, which adds the new task_struct and calls sched_post_fork()\nfor it.\n\nIn the above scenario there is a possibility that\nsetpriority(PRIO_PGRP) and set_one_prio() will be called for a thread\nin the group that is just being created by copy_process(), and for\nwhich the sched_post_fork() has not been executed yet. This will\ntrigger a null pointer dereference in reweight_entity(),\u00a0as it will\ntry to access the run queue pointer, which hasn't been set.\n\nBefore the mentioned change the cfs_rq pointer for the task  has been\nset in sched_fork(), which is called much earlier in copy_process(),\nbefore the new task is added to the thread_group.  Now it is done in\nthe sched_post_fork(), which is called after that.  To fix the issue\nthe remove the update_load param from the update_load param() function\nand call reweight_task() only if the task flag doesn't have the\nTASK_NEW flag set."
