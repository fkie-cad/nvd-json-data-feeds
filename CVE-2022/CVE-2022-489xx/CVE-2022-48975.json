      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ngpiolib: fix memory leak in gpiochip_setup_dev()\n\nHere is a backtrace report about memory leak detected in\ngpiochip_setup_dev():\n\nunreferenced object 0xffff88810b406400 (size 512):\n  comm \"python3\", pid 1682, jiffies 4295346908 (age 24.090s)\n  backtrace:\n    kmalloc_trace\n    device_add\t\tdevice_private_init at drivers/base/core.c:3361\n\t\t\t(inlined by) device_add at drivers/base/core.c:3411\n    cdev_device_add\n    gpiolib_cdev_register\n    gpiochip_setup_dev\n    gpiochip_add_data_with_key\n\ngcdev_register() & gcdev_unregister() would call device_add() &\ndevice_del() (no matter CONFIG_GPIO_CDEV is enabled or not) to\nregister/unregister device.\n\nHowever, if device_add() succeeds, some resource (like\nstruct device_private allocated by device_private_init())\nis not released by device_del().\n\nTherefore, after device_add() succeeds by gcdev_register(), it\nneeds to call put_device() to release resource in the error handle\npath.\n\nHere we move forward the register of release function, and let it\nrelease every piece of resource by put_device() instead of kfree().\n\nWhile at it, fix another subtle issue, i.e. when gc->ngpio is equal\nto 0, we still call kcalloc() and, in case of further error, kfree()\non the ZERO_PTR pointer, which is not NULL. It's not a bug per se,\nbut rather waste of the resources and potentially wrong expectation\nabout contents of the gdev->descs variable."
