In this case, the copy could be leaked.\n\nProperly free 'copy' in the error case for the allocation of 'filtered'\nfailing.\n\nNote that there may also have been a similar issue in\nkunit_filter_subsuites, before it was removed in \"kunit: flatten\nkunit_suite*** to kunit_suite** in .kunit_test_suites\".\n\nThis was reported by clang-analyzer via the kernel test robot, here:\nhttps://lore.kernel.org/all/c8073b8e-7b9e-0830-4177-87c12f16349c@intel.com/\n\nAnd by smatch via Dan Carpenter and the kernel test robot:\nhttps://lore.kernel.org/all/202207101328.ASjx88yj-lkp@intel.com/"
