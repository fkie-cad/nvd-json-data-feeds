      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: fix potential 32-bit overflow when accessing ARRAY map element\n\nIf BPF array map is bigger than 4GB, element pointer calculation can\noverflow because both index and elem_size are u32. Fix this everywhere\nby forcing 64-bit multiplication. Extract this formula into separate\nsmall helper and use it consistently in various places.\n\nSpeculative-preventing formula utilizing index_mask trick is left as is,\nbut explicit u64 casts are added in both places."
