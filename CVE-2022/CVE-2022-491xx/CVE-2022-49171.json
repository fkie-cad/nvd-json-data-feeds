      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\next4: don't BUG if someone dirty pages without asking ext4 first\n\n[un]pin_user_pages_remote is dirtying pages without properly warning\nthe file system in advance.  A related race was noted by Jan Kara in\n2018[1]; however, more recently instead of it being a very hard-to-hit\nrace, it could be reliably triggered by process_vm_writev(2) which was\ndiscovered by Syzbot[2].\n\nThis is technically a bug in mm/gup.c, but arguably ext4 is fragile in\nthat if some other kernel subsystem dirty pages without properly\nnotifying the file system using page_mkwrite(), ext4 will BUG, while\nother file systems will not BUG (although data will still be lost).\n\nSo instead of crashing with a BUG, issue a warning (since there may be\npotential data loss) and just mark the page as clean to avoid\nunprivileged denial of service attacks until the problem can be\nproperly fixed.  More discussion and background can be found in the\nthread starting at [2].\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20180103100430.GE4911@quack2.suse.cz\n[2] https://lore.kernel.org/r/Yg0m6IjcNmfaSokM@google.com"
