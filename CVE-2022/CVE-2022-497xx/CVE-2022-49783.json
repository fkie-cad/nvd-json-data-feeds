This\nproblem exists since commit\n\n  9e798e9aa14c (\"x86/fpu: Prepare fpu_clone() for dynamically enabled features\").\n\nEven though the original bug report should not have enabled the paths at\nall, the bug still exists.\n\nfpregs_lock is necessary when editing the FPU registers or a task's FP\nstate but it is not necessary for fpu_inherit_perms(). The only write\nof any FP state in fpu_inherit_perms() is for the new child which is\nnot running yet and cannot context switch or be borrowed by a kernel\nthread yet. Hence, fpregs_lock is not protecting anything in the new\nchild until clone() completes and can be dropped earlier. The siglock\nstill needs to be acquired by fpu_inherit_perms() as the read of the\nparent's permissions has to be serialised.\n\n  [ bp: Cleanup splat. ]"
