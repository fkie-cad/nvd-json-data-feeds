      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnilfs2: fix use-after-free bug of ns_writer on remount\n\nIf a nilfs2 filesystem is downgraded to read-only due to metadata\ncorruption on disk and is remounted read/write, or if emergency read-only\nremount is performed, detaching a log writer and synchronizing the\nfilesystem can be done at the same time.\n\nIn these cases, use-after-free of the log writer (hereinafter\nnilfs->ns_writer) can happen as shown in the scenario below:\n\n Task1                               Task2\n --------------------------------    ------------------------------\n nilfs_construct_segment\n   nilfs_segctor_sync\n     init_wait\n     init_waitqueue_entry\n     add_wait_queue\n     schedule\n                                     nilfs_remount (R/W remount case)\n\t\t\t\t       nilfs_attach_log_writer\n                                         nilfs_detach_log_writer\n                                           nilfs_segctor_destroy\n                                             kfree\n     finish_wait\n       _raw_spin_lock_irqsave\n         __raw_spin_lock_irqsave\n           do_raw_spin_lock\n             debug_spin_lock_before  <-- use-after-free\n\nWhile Task1 is sleeping, nilfs->ns_writer is freed by Task2.  After Task1\nwaked up, Task1 accesses nilfs->ns_writer which is already freed.  This\nscenario diagram is based on the Shigeru Yoshida's post [1].\n\nThis patch fixes the issue by not detaching nilfs->ns_writer on remount so\nthat this UAF race doesn't happen.  Along with this change, this patch\nalso inserts a few necessary read-only checks with superblock instance\nwhere only the ns_writer pointer was used to check if the filesystem is\nread-only."
