      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncan: gs_usb: gs_usb_open/close(): fix memory leak\n\nThe gs_usb driver appears to suffer from a malady common to many USB\nCAN adapter drivers in that it performs usb_alloc_coherent() to\nallocate a number of USB request blocks (URBs) for RX, and then later\nrelies on usb_kill_anchored_urbs() to free them, but this doesn't\nactually free them. As a result, this may be leaking DMA memory that's\nbeen used by the driver.\n\nThis commit is an adaptation of the techniques found in the esd_usb2\ndriver where a similar design pattern led to a memory leak. It\nexplicitly frees the RX URBs and their DMA memory via a call to\nusb_free_coherent(). Since the RX URBs were allocated in the\ngs_can_open(), we remove them in gs_can_close() rather than in the\ndisconnect function as was done in esd_usb2.\n\nFor more information, see the 928150fad41b (\"can: esd_usb2: fix memory\nleak\")."
