      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nigc: Reinstate IGC_REMOVED logic and implement it properly\n\nThe initially merged version of the igc driver code (via commit\n146740f9abc4, \"igc: Add support for PF\") contained the following\nIGC_REMOVED checks in the igc_rd32/wr32() MMIO accessors:\n\n\tu32 igc_rd32(struct igc_hw *hw, u32 reg)\n\t{\n\t\tu8 __iomem *hw_addr = READ_ONCE(hw->hw_addr);\n\t\tu32 value = 0;\n\n\t\tif (IGC_REMOVED(hw_addr))\n\t\t\treturn ~value;\n\n\t\tvalue = readl(&hw_addr[reg]);\n\n\t\t/* reads should not return all F's */\n\t\tif (!(~value) && (!reg || !(~readl(hw_addr))))\n\t\t\thw->hw_addr = NULL;\n\n\t\treturn value;\n\t}\n\nAnd:\n\n\t#define wr32(reg, val) \\\n\tdo { \\\n\t\tu8 __iomem *hw_addr = READ_ONCE((hw)->hw_addr); \\\n\t\tif (!IGC_REMOVED(hw_addr)) \\\n\t\t\twritel((val), &hw_addr[(reg)]); \\\n\t} while (0)\n\nE.g. igb has similar checks in its MMIO accessors, and has a similar\nmacro E1000_REMOVED, which is implemented as follows:\n\n\t#define E1000_REMOVED(h) unlikely(!(h))\n\nThese checks serve to detect and take note of an 0xffffffff MMIO read\nreturn from the device, which can be caused by a PCIe link flap or some\nother kind of PCI bus error, and to avoid performing MMIO reads and\nwrites from that point onwards.\n\nHowever, the IGC_REMOVED macro was not originally implemented:\n\n\t#ifndef IGC_REMOVED\n\t#define IGC_REMOVED(a) (0)\n\t#endif /* IGC_REMOVED */\n\nThis led to the IGC_REMOVED logic to be removed entirely in a\nsubsequent commit (commit 3c215fb18e70, \"igc: remove IGC_REMOVED\nfunction\"), with the rationale that such checks matter only for\nvirtualization and that igc does not support virtualization -- but a\nPCIe device can become detached even without virtualization being in\nuse, and without proper checks, a PCIe bus error affecting an igc\nadapter will lead to various NULL pointer dereferences, as the first\naccess after the error will set hw->hw_addr to NULL, and subsequent\naccesses will blindly dereference this now-NULL pointer.\n\nThis patch reinstates the IGC_REMOVED checks in igc_rd32/wr32(), and\nimplements IGC_REMOVED the way it is done for igb, by checking for the\nunlikely() case of hw_addr being NULL.  This change prevents the oopses\nseen when a PCIe link flap occurs on an igc adapter."
