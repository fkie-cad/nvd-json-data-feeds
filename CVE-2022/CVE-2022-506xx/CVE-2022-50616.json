And this causes\ninit data resource allocated to its parent, not itself. The issue happen\nwhen parent device is going to release and regulator core is still doing\nsome operation of init data constraint for the regulator of child device.\n\nTo fix it, this patch expand 'regulator_register' API to use the\ndifferent devices for init data allocation and DT lookup."
