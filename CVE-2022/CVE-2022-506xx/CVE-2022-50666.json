The calling RDMA core will free QP structure after\nsuccessful return from siw_qp_destroy() call, so siw must not\nhold any remaining reference to the QP upon return.\nA use-after-free was encountered in xfstest generic/460, while\ntesting NFSoRDMA. Here, after a TCP connection drop by peer,\nthe triggered siw_cm_work_handler got delayed until after\nQP destroy call, referencing a QP which has already freed."
