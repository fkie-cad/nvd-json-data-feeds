      "value": "Multiple Cisco&nbsp;products are affected by a vulnerability in the Ethernet Frame Decoder of the Snort detection engine that could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper handling of error conditions when processing Ethernet frames. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious Ethernet frames through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust disk space on the affected device, which could result in administrators being unable to log in to the device or the device being unable to boot up correctly.Note: Manual intervention is required to recover from this situation. Customers are advised to contact the Cisco&nbsp;Technical Assistance Center (TAC) to help recover a device in this condition.Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability."
