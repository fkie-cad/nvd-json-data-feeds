In\nthe error path, we weren't calling dma_fence_put() so all those fences\ngot leaked.  Also, in the krealloc_array failure case, we weren't\nfreeing the fences array.  Instead, ensure that i and fences are always\nzero-initialized and dma_fence_put() all the fences and kfree(fences) on\nevery error path."
