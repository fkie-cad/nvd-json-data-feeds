      "value": "The Opal Estate plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.6.11. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the opalestate_set_feature_property() and opalestate_remove_feature_property() functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to set and remove featured properties via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
