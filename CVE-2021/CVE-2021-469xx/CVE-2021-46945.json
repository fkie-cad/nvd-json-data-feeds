      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\next4: always panic when errors=panic is specified\n\nBefore commit 014c9caa29d3 (\"ext4: make ext4_abort() use\n__ext4_error()\"), the following series of commands would trigger a\npanic:\n\n1. mount /dev/sda -o ro,errors=panic test\n2. mount /dev/sda -o remount,abort test\n\nAfter commit 014c9caa29d3, remounting a file system using the test\nmount option \"abort\" will no longer trigger a panic.  This commit will\nrestore the behaviour immediately before commit 014c9caa29d3.\n(However, note that the Linux kernel's behavior has not been\nconsistent; some previous kernel versions, including 5.4 and 4.19\nsimilarly did not panic after using the mount option \"abort\".)\n\nThis also makes a change to long-standing behaviour; namely, the\nfollowing series commands will now cause a panic, when previously it\ndid not:\n\n1. mount /dev/sda -o ro,errors=panic test\n2. echo test > /sys/fs/ext4/sda/trigger_fs_error\n\nHowever, this makes ext4's behaviour much more consistent, so this is\na good thing."
