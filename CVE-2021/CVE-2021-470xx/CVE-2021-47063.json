However, since our\ndrm_connector is devm-allocated, by the time drm_mode_config_cleanup()\nwill be called, our connector will be long gone. Therefore, the\nconnector must be cleaned up when the bridge is detached to avoid\nuse-after-free conditions.\n\nv2: Cleanup connector only if it was created\n\nv3: Add FIXME\n\nv4: (Use connector->dev) directly in if() block"
