      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amd/display: Fix off by one in hdmi_14_process_transaction()\n\nThe hdcp_i2c_offsets[] array did not have an entry for\nHDCP_MESSAGE_ID_WRITE_CONTENT_STREAM_TYPE so it led to an off by one\nread overflow.  I added an entry and copied the 0x0 value for the offset\nfrom similar code in drivers/gpu/drm/amd/display/modules/hdcp/hdcp_ddc.c.\n\nI also declared several of these arrays as having HDCP_MESSAGE_ID_MAX\nentries.  This doesn't change the code, but it's just a belt and\nsuspenders approach to try future proof the code."
