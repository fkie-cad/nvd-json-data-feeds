      "value": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco&nbsp;AsyncOS Software for Cisco&nbsp;Content Security Management Appliance (SMA) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information on an affected device.\r\nThe vulnerability exists because confidential information is being included in HTTP requests that are exchanged between the user and the device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by looking at the raw HTTP requests that are sent to the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain some of the passwords that are configured throughout the interface.Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability."
