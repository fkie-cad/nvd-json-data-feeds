      "value": "The Frontend File Manager (versions < 4.0), N-Media Post Front-end Form (versions < 1.1) plugins for WordPress are vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation via the `nm_filemanager_upload_file` and `nm_postfront_upload_file` AJAX actions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible."
