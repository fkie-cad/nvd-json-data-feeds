In versions from 0.6.4 to before 0.12.0, users can crash the vLLM engine serving multimodal models that use the Idefics3 vision model implementation by sending a specially crafted 1x1 pixel image. This causes a tensor dimension mismatch that results in an unhandled runtime error, leading to complete server termination. This issue has been patched in version 0.12.0."
