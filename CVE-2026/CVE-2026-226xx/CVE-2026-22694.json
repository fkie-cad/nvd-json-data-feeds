AliasVault Android versions 0.24.0 through 0.25.2 contained an issue in how passkey requests from Android apps were validated. Under certain local conditions, a malicious app could attempt to obtain a passkey response for a site it was not authorized to access. The issue involved incomplete validation of calling app identity, origin, and RP ID in the Android credential provider. This issue was fixed in AliasVault Android 0.25.3."
