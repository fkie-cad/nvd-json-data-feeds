      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnfsd: provide locking for v4_end_grace\n\nWriting to v4_end_grace can race with server shutdown and result in\nmemory being accessed after it was freed - reclaim_str_hashtbl in\nparticularly.\n\nWe cannot hold nfsd_mutex across the nfsd4_end_grace() call as that is\nheld while client_tracking_op->init() is called and that can wait for\nan upcall to nfsdcltrack which can write to v4_end_grace, resulting in a\ndeadlock.\n\nnfsd4_end_grace() is also called by the landromat work queue and this\ndoesn't require locking as server shutdown will stop the work and wait\nfor it before freeing anything that nfsd4_end_grace() might access.\n\nHowever, we must be sure that writing to v4_end_grace doesn't restart\nthe work item after shutdown has already waited for it.  For this we\nadd a new flag protected with nn->client_lock.  It is set only while it\nis safe to make client tracking calls, and v4_end_grace only schedules\nwork while the flag is set with the spinlock held.\n\nSo this patch adds a nfsd_net field \"client_tracking_active\" which is\nset as described.  Another field \"grace_end_forced\", is set when\nv4_end_grace is written.  After this is set, and providing\nclient_tracking_active is set, the laundromat is scheduled.\nThis \"grace_end_forced\" field bypasses other checks for whether the\ngrace period has finished.\n\nThis resolves a race which can result in use-after-free."
