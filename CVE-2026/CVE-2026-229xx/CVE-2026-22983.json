      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: do not write to msg_get_inq in callee\n\nNULL pointer dereference fix.\n\nmsg_get_inq is an input field from caller to callee. Don't set it in\nthe callee, as the caller may not clear it on struct reuse.\n\nThis is a kernel-internal variant of msghdr only, and the only user\ndoes reinitialize the field. So this is not critical for that reason.\nBut it is more robust to avoid the write, and slightly simpler code.\nAnd it fixes a bug, see below.\n\nCallers set msg_get_inq to request the input queue length to be\nreturned in msg_inq. This is equivalent to but independent from the\nSO_INQ request to return that same info as a cmsg (tp->recvmsg_inq).\nTo reduce branching in the hot path the second also sets the msg_inq.\nThat is WAI.\n\nThis is a fix to commit 4d1442979e4a (\"af_unix: don't post cmsg for\nSO_INQ unless explicitly asked for\"), which fixed the inverse.\n\nAlso avoid NULL pointer dereference in unix_stream_read_generic if\nstate->msg is NULL and msg->msg_get_inq is written. A NULL state->msg\ncan happen when splicing as of commit 2b514574f7e8 (\"net: af_unix:\nimplement splice for stream af_unix sockets\").\n\nAlso collapse two branches using a bitwise or."
