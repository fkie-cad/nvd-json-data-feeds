      "value": "NocoDB is software for building databases as spreadsheets. Prior to version 0.301.0, an authenticated user with org-level-creator permissions can exploit prototype pollution in the `/api/v2/meta/connection/test` endpoint, causing all database write operations to fail application-wide until server restart. While the pollution technically bypasses SUPER_ADMIN authorization checks, no practical privileged actions can be performed because database operations fail immediately after pollution. Version 0.301.0 patches the issue."
