Module removal with active\nentries causes memory leak as the list is not properly cleaned up.\n\nPrevent this by iterating through the remaining entries in the list and\nfreeing the associated memory during module removal. Add a spinlock\n(flow_steer_list_lock) to protect the list access from multiple threads."
