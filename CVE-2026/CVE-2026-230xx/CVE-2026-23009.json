      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nxhci: sideband: don't dereference freed ring when removing sideband endpoint\n\nxhci_sideband_remove_endpoint() incorrecly assumes that the endpoint is\nrunning and has a valid transfer ring.\n\nLianqin reported a crash during suspend/wake-up stress testing, and\nfound the cause to be dereferencing a non-existing transfer ring\n'ep->ring' during xhci_sideband_remove_endpoint().\n\nThe endpoint and its ring may be in unknown state if this function\nis called after xHCI was reinitialized in resume (lost power), or if\ndevice is being re-enumerated, disconnected or endpoint already dropped.\n\nFix this by both removing unnecessary ring access, and by checking\nep->ring exists before dereferencing it. Also make sure endpoint is\nrunning before attempting to stop it.\n\nRemove the xhci_initialize_ring_info() call during sideband endpoint\nremoval as is it only initializes ring structure enqueue, dequeue and\ncycle state values to their starting values without changing actual\nhardware enqueue, dequeue and cycle state. Leaving them out of sync\nis worse than leaving it as it is. The endpoint will get freed in after\nthis in most usecases.\n\nIf the (audio) class driver want's to reuse the endpoint after offload\nthen it is up to the class driver to ensure endpoint is properly set up."
