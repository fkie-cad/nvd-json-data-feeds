      "value": "A flaw was found in libsoup, an HTTP client library. This vulnerability, known as CRLF (Carriage Return Line Feed) Injection, occurs when an HTTP proxy is configured and the library improperly handles URL-decoded input used to create the Host header. A remote attacker can exploit this by providing a specially crafted URL containing CRLF sequences, allowing them to inject additional HTTP headers or complete HTTP request bodies. This can lead to unintended or unauthorized HTTP requests being forwarded by the proxy, potentially impacting downstream services."
