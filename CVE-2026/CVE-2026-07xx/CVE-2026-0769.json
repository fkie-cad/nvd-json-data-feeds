This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Langflow. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the implementation of eval_custom_component_code function. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute python code. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-26972."
