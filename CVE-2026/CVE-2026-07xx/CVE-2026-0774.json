This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of WatchYourLAN. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of the arpstrs parameter. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the service account. Was ZDI-CAN-26708."
