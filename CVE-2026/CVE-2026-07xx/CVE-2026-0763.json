This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of GPT Academic. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the run_in_subprocess_wrapper_func function. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in deserialization of untrusted data. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-27958."
