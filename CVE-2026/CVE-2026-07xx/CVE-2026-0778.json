This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Enel X JuiceBox 40 charging stations. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the telnet service, which listens on TCP port 2000 by default. The issue results from the lack of authentication prior to allowing remote connections. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the service account. Was ZDI-CAN-23285."
