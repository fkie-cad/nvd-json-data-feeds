This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Open WebUI. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the load_tool_module_by_id function. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute Python code. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the service account. Was ZDI-CAN-28257."
