      "value": "Upsonic Cloudpickle Deserialization of Untrusted Data Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Upsonic. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the add_tool endpoint, which listens on TCP port 7541 by default. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in deserialization of untrusted data. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the service account. Was ZDI-CAN-26845."
