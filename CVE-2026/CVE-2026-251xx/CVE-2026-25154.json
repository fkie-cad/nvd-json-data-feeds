      "value": "LocalSend is a free, open-source app that allows users to share files and messages with nearby devices over their local network without needing an internet connection. In versions up to and including 1.17.0, when a user initiates a \"Share via Link\" session, the LocalSend application starts a local HTTP server to host the selected files. The client-side logic for this web interface is contained in `app/assets/web/main.js`. Note that at [0], the `handleFilesDisplay` function constructs the HTML for the file list by iterating over the files received from the server. Commit 8f3cec85aa29b2b13fed9b2f8e499e1ac9b0504c contains a patch."
