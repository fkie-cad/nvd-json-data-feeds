      "value": "NiceGUI is a Python-based UI framework. From versions v2.10.0 to 3.4.1, an unauthenticated attacker can exhaust Redis connections by repeatedly opening and closing browser tabs on any NiceGUI application using Redis-backed storage. Connections are never released, leading to service degradation when Redis hits its connection limit. NiceGUI continues accepting new connections - errors are logged but the app stays up with broken storage functionality. This issue has been patched in version 3.5.0."
