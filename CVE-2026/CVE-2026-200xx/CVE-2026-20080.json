      "value": "A vulnerability in the SSH service of Cisco IEC6400 Wireless Backhaul Edge Compute Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the SSH service to stop responding.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because the SSH service lacks effective flood protection. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by initiating a denial of service (DoS) attack against the SSH port. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the SSH service to be unresponsive during the period of the DoS attack. All other operations remain stable during the attack."
