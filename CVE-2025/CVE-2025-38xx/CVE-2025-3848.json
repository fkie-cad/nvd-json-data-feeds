      "value": "The Download Manager and Payment Form WordPress Plugin \u2013 WP SmartPay plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in versions 1.1.0 to 2.7.13. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their email through the update() function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to change arbitrary user's email addresses, including administrators, and leverage that to reset the user's password and gain access to their account."
