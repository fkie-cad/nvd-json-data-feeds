      "value": "evernote-mcp-server openBrowser Command Injection Privilege Escalation Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of evernote-mcp-server. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the openBrowser function. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the service account. Was ZDI-CAN-27913."
