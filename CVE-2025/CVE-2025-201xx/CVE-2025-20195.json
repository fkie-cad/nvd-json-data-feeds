      "value": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform a CSRF attack and execute commands on the CLI of an affected device.\r\n\r\n This vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading an already authenticated user to follow a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to clear the syslog, parser, and licensing logs on the affected device if the targeted user has privileges to clear those logs."
