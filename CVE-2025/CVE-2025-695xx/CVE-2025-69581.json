The Social Network /personal_data endpoint exposes full sensitive user information even after logout because proper cache-control is missing. Using the browser back button restores all personal data, allowing unauthorized users on the same device to view confidential information. This leads to profiling, impersonation, targeted attacks, and significant privacy risks."
