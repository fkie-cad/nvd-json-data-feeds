This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with customer-level permissions and above, to read or modify other vendors' store settings including sensitive payment information (PayPal email, bank account details, routing numbers, IBAN, SWIFT codes), phone numbers, and addresses, and change PayPal email addresses to attacker-controlled addresses, enabling financial theft when the marketplace processes payouts."
