      "value": "The Blog2Social: Social Media Auto Post & Scheduler plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 8.7.2. This is due to a misconfigured authorization check on the 'getShipItemFullText' function which only verifies that a user has the 'read' capability (Subscriber-level) and a valid nonce, but fails to verify whether the user has permission to access the specific post being requested. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to extract data from password-protected, private, or draft posts."
