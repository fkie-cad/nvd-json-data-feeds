      "value": "A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in SpatialReference.org (OSGeo/spatialreference.org) versions prior to 2025-05-17 (commit 2120adfa17ddd535bd0f539e6c4988fa3a2cb491). The vulnerability is caused by improper handling of user input in the search query parameter. An attacker can craft a specially formed URL with malicious JavaScript code, which is then reflected back and executed in the victim's browser. This flaw allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the victim's session, potentially leading to session hijacking, phishing attacks, data theft, or redirection to malicious sites. The issue is exposed on publicly accessible pages, making it exploitable by an unauthenticated attacker."
