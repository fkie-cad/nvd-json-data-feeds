      "value": "PostgreSQL optimizer statistics allow a user to read sampled data within a view that the user cannot access.  Separately, statistics allow a user to read sampled data that a row security policy intended to hide.  PostgreSQL maintains statistics for tables by sampling data available in columns; this data is consulted during the query planning process.  Prior to this release, a user could craft a leaky operator that bypassed view access control lists (ACLs) and bypassed row security policies in partitioning or table inheritance hierarchies.  Reachable statistics data notably included histograms and most-common-values lists.  CVE-2017-7484 and CVE-2019-10130 intended to close this class of vulnerability, but this gap remained.  Versions before PostgreSQL 17.6, 16.10, 15.14, 14.19, and 13.22 are affected."
