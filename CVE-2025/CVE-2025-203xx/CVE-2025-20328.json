Cisco has addressed this vulnerability in the Cisco Webex Meetings service, and no customer action is needed.\r\n\r This vulnerability existed because of insufficient validation of user-supplied input to the user profile component of Cisco Webex Meetings. Prior to this vulnerability being addressed, an attacker could have exploited this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could have allowed the attacker to conduct an XSS attack against the targeted user."
