The attacker would need valid read-only user credentials.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper role-based access control (RBAC). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to an affected system and modifying certain policy configurations. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to modify policy configurations that are reserved for the Administrator role. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid credentials for a user account with at least the role of Observer."
