An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by directly accessing a troubleshoot file for a different domain that is managed on the same Cisco Secure FMC instance. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve a troubleshoot file for a different domain, which could allow the attacker to access sensitive information contained in the troubleshoot file."
