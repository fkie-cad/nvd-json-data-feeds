An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary file writes to specific directories in the underlying operating system.\r\nNote: To exploit this vulnerability, Web Access must be enabled on the phone. Web Access is disabled by default."
