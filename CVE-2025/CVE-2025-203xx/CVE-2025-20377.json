An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a valid request to a specific API endpoint within the affected system. A successful exploit could allow a low-privileged user to view sensitive information on the affected system that should be restricted. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid user credentials on the affected system."
