      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\narm64: mte: Do not warn if the page is already tagged in copy_highpage()\n\nThe arm64 copy_highpage() assumes that the destination page is newly\nallocated and not MTE-tagged (PG_mte_tagged unset) and warns\naccordingly. However, following commit 060913999d7a (\"mm: migrate:\nsupport poisoned recover from migrate folio\"), folio_mc_copy() is called\nbefore __folio_migrate_mapping(). If the latter fails (-EAGAIN), the\ncopy will be done again to the same destination page. Since\ncopy_highpage() already set the PG_mte_tagged flag, this second copy\nwill warn.\n\nReplace the WARN_ON_ONCE(page already tagged) in the arm64\ncopy_highpage() with a comment."
