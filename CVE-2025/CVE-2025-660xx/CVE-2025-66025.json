Prior to version 0.53.0, the Markdown renderer used in Caido\u2019s Findings page improperly handled user-supplied Markdown, allowing attacker-controlled links to be rendered without confirmation. When a user opened a finding generated through the scanner, or other plugins, clicking these injected links could redirect the Caido application to an attacker-controlled domain, enabling phishing style attacks. This issue has been patched in version 0.53.0."
