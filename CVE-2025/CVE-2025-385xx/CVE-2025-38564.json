      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nperf/core: Handle buffer mapping fail correctly in perf_mmap()\n\nAfter successful allocation of a buffer or a successful attachment to an\nexisting buffer perf_mmap() tries to map the buffer read only into the page\ntable. If that fails, the already set up page table entries are zapped, but\nthe other perf specific side effects of that failure are not handled.  The\ncalling code just cleans up the VMA and does not invoke perf_mmap_close().\n\nThis leaks reference counts, corrupts user->vm accounting and also results\nin an unbalanced invocation of event::event_mapped().\n\nCure this by moving the event::event_mapped() invocation before the\nmap_range() call so that on map_range() failure perf_mmap_close() can be\ninvoked without causing an unbalanced event::event_unmapped() call.\n\nperf_mmap_close() undoes the reference counts and eventually frees buffers."
