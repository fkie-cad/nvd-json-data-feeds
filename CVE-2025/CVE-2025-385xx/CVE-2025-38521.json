      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/imagination: Fix kernel crash when hard resetting the GPU\n\nThe GPU hard reset sequence calls pm_runtime_force_suspend() and\npm_runtime_force_resume(), which according to their documentation should\nonly be used during system-wide PM transitions to sleep states.\n\nThe main issue though is that depending on some internal runtime PM\nstate as seen by pm_runtime_force_suspend() (whether the usage count is\n<= 1), pm_runtime_force_resume() might not resume the device unless\nneeded. If that happens, the runtime PM resume callback\npvr_power_device_resume() is not called, the GPU clocks are not\nre-enabled, and the kernel crashes on the next attempt to access GPU\nregisters as part of the power-on sequence.\n\nReplace calls to pm_runtime_force_suspend() and\npm_runtime_force_resume() with direct calls to the driver's runtime PM\ncallbacks, pvr_power_device_suspend() and pvr_power_device_resume(),\nto ensure clocks are re-enabled and avoid the kernel crash."
