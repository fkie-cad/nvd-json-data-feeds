      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\next4: fix inode use after free in ext4_end_io_rsv_work()\n\nIn ext4_io_end_defer_completion(), check if io_end->list_vec is empty to\navoid adding an io_end that requires no conversion to the\ni_rsv_conversion_list, which in turn prevents starting an unnecessary\nworker. An ext4_emergency_state() check is also added to avoid attempting\nto abort the journal in an emergency state.\n\nAdditionally, ext4_put_io_end_defer() is refactored to call\next4_io_end_defer_completion() directly instead of being open-coded.\nThis also prevents starting an unnecessary worker when EXT4_IO_END_FAILED\nis set but data_err=abort is not enabled.\n\nThis ensures that the check in ext4_put_io_end_defer() is consistent with\nthe check in ext4_end_bio(). Otherwise, we might add an io_end to the\ni_rsv_conversion_list and then call ext4_finish_bio(), after which the\ninode could be freed before ext4_end_io_rsv_work() is called, triggering\na use-after-free issue."
