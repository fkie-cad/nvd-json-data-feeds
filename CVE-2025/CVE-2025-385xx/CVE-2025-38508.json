      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86/sev: Use TSC_FACTOR for Secure TSC frequency calculation\n\nWhen using Secure TSC, the GUEST_TSC_FREQ MSR reports a frequency based on\nthe nominal P0 frequency, which deviates slightly (typically ~0.2%) from\nthe actual mean TSC frequency due to clocking parameters.\n\nOver extended VM uptime, this discrepancy accumulates, causing clock skew\nbetween the hypervisor and a SEV-SNP VM, leading to early timer interrupts as\nperceived by the guest.\n\nThe guest kernel relies on the reported nominal frequency for TSC-based\ntimekeeping, while the actual frequency set during SNP_LAUNCH_START may\ndiffer. This mismatch results in inaccurate time calculations, causing the\nguest to perceive hrtimers as firing earlier than expected.\n\nUtilize the TSC_FACTOR from the SEV firmware's secrets page (see \"Secrets\nPage Format\" in the SNP Firmware ABI Specification) to calculate the mean\nTSC frequency, ensuring accurate timekeeping and mitigating clock skew in\nSEV-SNP VMs.\n\nUse early_ioremap_encrypted() to map the secrets page as\nioremap_encrypted() uses kmalloc() which is not available during early TSC\ninitialization and causes a panic.\n\n  [ bp: Drop the silly dummy var:\n    https://lore.kernel.org/r/20250630192726.GBaGLlHl84xIopx4Pt@fat_crate.local ]"
