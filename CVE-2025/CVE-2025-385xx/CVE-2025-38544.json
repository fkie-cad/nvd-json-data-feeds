      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nrxrpc: Fix bug due to prealloc collision\n\nWhen userspace is using AF_RXRPC to provide a server, it has to preallocate\nincoming calls and assign to them call IDs that will be used to thread\nrelated recvmsg() and sendmsg() together.  The preallocated call IDs will\nautomatically be attached to calls as they come in until the pool is empty.\n\nTo the kernel, the call IDs are just arbitrary numbers, but userspace can\nuse the call ID to hold a pointer to prepared structs.  In any case, the\nuser isn't permitted to create two calls with the same call ID (call IDs\nbecome available again when the call ends) and EBADSLT should result from\nsendmsg() if an attempt is made to preallocate a call with an in-use call\nID.\n\nHowever, the cleanup in the error handling will trigger both assertions in\nrxrpc_cleanup_call() because the call isn't marked complete and isn't\nmarked as having been released.\n\nFix this by setting the call state in rxrpc_service_prealloc_one() and then\nmarking it as being released before calling the cleanup function."
