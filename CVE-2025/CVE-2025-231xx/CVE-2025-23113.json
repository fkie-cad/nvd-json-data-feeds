      "value": "An issue was discovered in REDCap 14.9.6. It has an action=myprojects&logout=1 CSRF issue in the alert-title while performing an upload of a CSV file containing a list of alert configuration. An attacker can send the victim a CSV file containing an HTML injection payload in the alert-title. Once the victim uploads the file, he automatically lands on a page to view the uploaded data. If the victim click on the alert-title value, it can trigger a logout request and terminates their session, or redirect to a phishing website. This vulnerability stems from the absence of CSRF protections on the logout functionality."
