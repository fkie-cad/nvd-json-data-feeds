      "value": "The Versa Director SD-WAN orchestration platform includes functionality to initiate SSH sessions to remote CPEs and the Director shell via Shell-In-A-Box. The underlying Python script, shell-connect.py, is vulnerable to command injection through the user argument. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system. \r\n\r\nExploitation Status: \r\n\r\nVersa Networks is not aware of any reported instance where this vulnerability was exploited. Proof of concept for this vulnerability has been disclosed by third party security researchers.  \r\n\r\nWorkarounds or Mitigation: \r\n\r\nThere are no workarounds to disable the GUI option. Versa recommends that Director be upgraded to one of the remediated software versions."
