      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndlm: prevent NPD when writing a positive value to event_done\n\ndo_uevent returns the value written to event_done. In case it is a\npositive value, new_lockspace would undo all the work, and lockspace\nwould not be set. __dlm_new_lockspace, however, would treat that\npositive value as a success due to commit 8511a2728ab8 (\"dlm: fix use\ncount with multiple joins\").\n\nDown the line, device_create_lockspace would pass that NULL lockspace to\ndlm_find_lockspace_local, leading to a NULL pointer dereference.\n\nTreating such positive values as successes prevents the problem. Given\nthis has been broken for so long, this is unlikely to break userspace\nexpectations."
