However, in\nenable_streams, it is assumed that link training succeeded and the\nmux selects the phy clock, causing a hang when a register write is made.\n\n[How]\nWhen enable_stream is hit, check if link training failed. If it did, fall\nback to the ref clock to avoid a hang and keep the system in a recoverable\nstate."
