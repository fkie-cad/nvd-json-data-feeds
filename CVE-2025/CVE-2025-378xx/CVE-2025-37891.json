      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nALSA: ump: Fix buffer overflow at UMP SysEx message conversion\n\nThe conversion function from MIDI 1.0 to UMP packet contains an\ninternal buffer to keep the incoming MIDI bytes, and its size is 4, as\nit was supposed to be the max size for a MIDI1 UMP packet data.\nHowever, the implementation overlooked that SysEx is handled in a\ndifferent format, and it can be up to 6 bytes, as found in\ndo_convert_to_ump().  It leads eventually to a buffer overflow, and\nmay corrupt the memory when a longer SysEx message is received.\n\nThe fix is simply to extend the buffer size to 6 to fit with the SysEx\nUMP message."
