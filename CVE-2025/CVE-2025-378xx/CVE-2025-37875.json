      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nigc: fix PTM cycle trigger logic\n\nWriting to clear the PTM status 'valid' bit while the PTM cycle is\ntriggered results in unreliable PTM operation. To fix this, clear the\nPTM 'trigger' and status after each PTM transaction.\n\nThe issue can be reproduced with the following:\n\n$ sudo phc2sys -R 1000 -O 0 -i tsn0 -m\n\nNote: 1000 Hz (-R 1000) is unrealistically large, but provides a way to\nquickly reproduce the issue.\n\nPHC2SYS exits with:\n\n\"ioctl PTP_OFFSET_PRECISE: Connection timed out\" when the PTM transaction\n  fails\n\nThis patch also fixes a hang in igc_probe() when loading the igc\ndriver in the kdump kernel on systems supporting PTM.\n\nThe igc driver running in the base kernel enables PTM trigger in\nigc_probe().  Therefore the driver is always in PTM trigger mode,\nexcept in brief periods when manually triggering a PTM cycle.\n\nWhen a crash occurs, the NIC is reset while PTM trigger is enabled.\nDue to a hardware problem, the NIC is subsequently in a bad busmaster\nstate and doesn't handle register reads/writes.  When running\nigc_probe() in the kdump kernel, the first register access to a NIC\nregister hangs driver probing and ultimately breaks kdump.\n\nWith this patch, igc has PTM trigger disabled most of the time,\nand the trigger is only enabled for very brief (10 - 100 us) periods\nwhen manually triggering a PTM cycle.  Chances that a crash occurs\nduring a PTM trigger are not 0, but extremely reduced."
