This allows remote attackers with network access to the Fluent Bit instance exposing the forward input to send unauthenticated data. By bypassing authentication controls, attackers can inject forged log records, flood alerting systems, or manipulate routing decisions, compromising the authenticity and integrity of ingested logs."
