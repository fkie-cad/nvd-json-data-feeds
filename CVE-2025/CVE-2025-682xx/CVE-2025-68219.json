      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncifs: fix memory leak in smb3_fs_context_parse_param error path\n\nAdd proper cleanup of ctx->source and fc->source to the\ncifs_parse_mount_err error handler. This ensures that memory allocated\nfor the source strings is correctly freed on all error paths, matching\nthe cleanup already performed in the success path by\nsmb3_cleanup_fs_context_contents().\nPointers are also set to NULL after freeing to prevent potential\ndouble-free issues.\n\nThis change fixes a memory leak originally detected by syzbot. The\nleak occurred when processing Opt_source mount options if an error\nhappened after ctx->source and fc->source were successfully\nallocated but before the function completed.\n\nThe specific leak sequence was:\n1. ctx->source = smb3_fs_context_fullpath(ctx, '/') allocates memory\n2. fc->source = kstrdup(ctx->source, GFP_KERNEL) allocates more memory\n3. A subsequent error jumps to cifs_parse_mount_err\n4. The old error handler freed passwords but not the source strings,\ncausing the memory to leak.\n\nThis issue was not addressed by commit e8c73eb7db0a (\"cifs: client:\nfix memory leak in smb3_fs_context_parse_param\"), which only fixed\nleaks from repeated fsconfig() calls but not this error path.\n\nPatch updated with minor change suggested by kernel test robot"
