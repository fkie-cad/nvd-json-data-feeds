      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm, fbcon, vga_switcheroo: Avoid race condition in fbcon setup\n\nProtect vga_switcheroo_client_fb_set() with console lock. Avoids OOB\naccess in fbcon_remap_all(). Without holding the console lock the call\nraces with switching outputs.\n\nVGA switcheroo calls fbcon_remap_all() when switching clients. The fbcon\nfunction uses struct fb_info.node, which is set by register_framebuffer().\nAs the fb-helper code currently sets up VGA switcheroo before registering\nthe framebuffer, the value of node is -1 and therefore not a legal value.\nFor example, fbcon uses the value within set_con2fb_map() [1] as an index\ninto an array.\n\nMoving vga_switcheroo_client_fb_set() after register_framebuffer() can\nresult in VGA switching that does not switch fbcon correctly.\n\nTherefore move vga_switcheroo_client_fb_set() under fbcon_fb_registered(),\nwhich already holds the console lock. Fbdev calls fbcon_fb_registered()\nfrom within register_framebuffer(). Serializes the helper with VGA\nswitcheroo's call to fbcon_remap_all().\n\nAlthough vga_switcheroo_client_fb_set() takes an instance of struct fb_info\nas parameter, it really only needs the contained fbcon state. Moving the\ncall to fbcon initialization is therefore cleaner than before. Only amdgpu,\ni915, nouveau and radeon support vga_switcheroo. For all other drivers,\nthis change does nothing."
