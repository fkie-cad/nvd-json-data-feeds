As reported in the Closes tag URL, the WARN indicates that\na deadlock can happen due to the dependency among disk->open_mutex,\nkblockd workqueue completion and partition_scan_work completion.\n\nTo avoid the lockdep WARN and the potential deadlock, cut the dependency\nby running the partition_scan_work not by kblockd workqueue but by\nnvme_wq."
