      "value": "Autel MaxiCharger AC Wallbox Commercial Firmware Downgrade Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Autel MaxiCharger AC Wallbox Commercial charging stations. An attacker must first obtain the ability to pair a malicious Bluetooth device with the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the firmware update process. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a firmware image before using it to perform an upgrade. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the device. Was ZDI-CAN-26354."
