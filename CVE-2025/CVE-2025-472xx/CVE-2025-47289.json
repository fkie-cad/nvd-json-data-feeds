A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in CE Phoenix versions 1.0.9.9 through 1.1.0.2 where an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the testimonial description field. Once submitted, if the shop owner (admin) approves the testimonial, the script executes in the context of any user visiting the testimonial page. Because the session cookies are not marked with the `HttpOnly` flag, they can be exfiltrated by the attacker \u2014 potentially leading to account takeover. Version 1.1.0.3 fixes the issue."
