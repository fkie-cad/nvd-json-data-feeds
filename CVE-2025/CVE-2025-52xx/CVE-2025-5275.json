      "value": "The Charitable \u2013 Donation Plugin for WordPress \u2013 Fundraising with Recurring Donations & More plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the privacy settings fields in all versions up to, and including, 1.8.6.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.\r\nThis issue was partially fixed in version 1.8.6.1 and fully fixed in version 1.8.6.2."
