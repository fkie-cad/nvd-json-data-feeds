      "value": "The WPGYM - Wordpress Gym Management System plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 67.7.0 via the 'page' parameter. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other \u201csafe\u201d file types can be uploaded and included. The Local File Inclusion exploit can be chained to include various dashboard view files in the plugin. One in particular reported by the researcher can be leveraged to update the password of Super Administrator accounts in Multisite environments making privilege escalation possible."
