An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious data into specific pages of the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must be a member of the Administrator or AAA Administrator role."
