      "value": "A vulnerability in the packet inspection functionality of the Snort 3 Detection Engine of Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of traffic that is inspected by an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted traffic through the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to enter an infinite loop while inspecting traffic, resulting in a DoS condition. The system watchdog will restart the Snort process automatically."
