An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed IKEv2 packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to prevent the affected device from processing any control plane UDP packets, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability."
