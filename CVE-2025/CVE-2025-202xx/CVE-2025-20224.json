      "value": "A vulnerability in the Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) module of Cisco Secure Firewall Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Secure Firewall Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a memory leak, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to improper parsing of IKEv2 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a continuous stream of crafted IKEv2 packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to partially exhaust system memory, causing system instability like being unable to establish new IKEv2 VPN sessions. A manual reboot of the device is required to recover from this condition."
