To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid user credentials on the affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by entering crafted input as the argument of an affected CLI command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read and write files on the underlying operating system with the privileges of a non-root user account. File system access is limited to the permissions that are granted to that non-root user account."
