      "value": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Intelligence Center could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to upload arbitrary files to an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper validation of files that are uploaded to the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading arbitrary files to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to store malicious files on the system and execute arbitrary commands on the operating system. The Security Impact Rating (SIR) of this advisory has been raised to High because an attacker could elevate privileges to root. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid credentials for a user account with at least the role of Report Designer."
