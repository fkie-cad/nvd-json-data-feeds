To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid administrative credentials.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insecure deserialization of Java objects by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted Java object to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system of an affected device as a low-privilege user. A successful exploit could also allow the attacker to undertake further actions to elevate their privileges to root."
