In @remix-run/react versions 1.15.0 through 2.17.0. and react-router versions 7.0.0 through 7.8.2, a XSS vulnerability exists in in React Router's meta()/<Meta> APIs in Framework Mode when generating script:ld+json tags which could allow arbitrary JavaScript execution during SSR if untrusted content is used to generate the tag. There is no impact if the application is being used in Declarative Mode (<BrowserRouter>) or Data Mode (createBrowserRouter/<RouterProvider>). This issue has been patched in @remix-run/react version 2.17.1 and react-router version 7.9.0."
