      "value": "Misskey is an open source, federated social media platform. Starting in version 12.31.0 and prior to version 2025.4.1, missing validation in `Mk:api` allows malicious AiScript code to access additional endpoints that it isn't designed to have access to. The missing validation allows malicious AiScript code to prefix a URL with `../` to step out of the `/api` directory, thereby being able to make requests to other endpoints, such as `/files`, `/url`, and `/proxy`. Version 2025.4.1 fixes the issue."
