Taking the reference prevents the\ngeometry job being freed until the fragment job no longer requires it.\n\nFixes a use after free bug detected by KASAN:\n\n[  124.256386] BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in pvr_queue_prepare_job+0x108/0x868 [powervr]\n[  124.264893] Read of size 1 at addr ffff0000084cb960 by task kworker/u16:4/63"
