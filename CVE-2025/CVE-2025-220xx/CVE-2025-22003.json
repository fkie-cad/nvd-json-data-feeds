      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncan: ucan: fix out of bound read in strscpy() source\n\nCommit 7fdaf8966aae (\"can: ucan: use strscpy() to instead of strncpy()\")\nunintentionally introduced a one byte out of bound read on strscpy()'s\nsource argument (which is kind of ironic knowing that strscpy() is meant\nto be a more secure alternative :)).\n\nLet's consider below buffers:\n\n  dest[len + 1]; /* will be NUL terminated */\n  src[len]; /* may not be NUL terminated */\n\nWhen doing:\n\n  strncpy(dest, src, len);\n  dest[len] = '\\0';\n\nstrncpy() will read up to len bytes from src.\n\nOn the other hand:\n\n  strscpy(dest, src, len + 1);\n\nwill read up to len + 1 bytes from src, that is to say, an out of bound\nread of one byte will occur on src if it is not NUL terminated. Note\nthat the src[len] byte is never copied, but strscpy() still needs to\nread it to check whether a truncation occurred or not.\n\nThis exact pattern happened in ucan.\n\nThe root cause is that the source is not NUL terminated. Instead of\ndoing a copy in a local buffer, directly NUL terminate it as soon as\nusb_control_msg() returns. With this, the local firmware_str[] variable\ncan be removed.\n\nOn top of this do a couple refactors:\n\n  - ucan_ctl_payload->raw is only used for the firmware string, so\n    rename it to ucan_ctl_payload->fw_str and change its type from u8 to\n    char.\n\n  - ucan_device_request_in() is only used to retrieve the firmware\n    string, so rename it to ucan_get_fw_str() and refactor it to make it\n    directly handle all the string termination logic."
