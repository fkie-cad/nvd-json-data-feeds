      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nksmbd: fix overflow in dacloffset bounds check\n\nThe dacloffset field was originally typed as int and used in an\nunchecked addition, which could overflow and bypass the existing\nbounds check in both smb_check_perm_dacl() and smb_inherit_dacl().\n\nThis could result in out-of-bounds memory access and a kernel crash\nwhen dereferencing the DACL pointer.\n\nThis patch converts dacloffset to unsigned int and uses\ncheck_add_overflow() to validate access to the DACL."
