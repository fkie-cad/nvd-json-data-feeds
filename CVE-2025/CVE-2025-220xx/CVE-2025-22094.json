      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npowerpc/perf: Fix ref-counting on the PMU 'vpa_pmu'\n\nCommit 176cda0619b6 (\"powerpc/perf: Add perf interface to expose vpa\ncounters\") introduced 'vpa_pmu' to expose Book3s-HV nested APIv2 provided\nL1<->L2 context switch latency counters to L1 user-space via\nperf-events. However the newly introduced PMU named 'vpa_pmu' doesn't\nassign ownership of the PMU to the module 'vpa_pmu'. Consequently the\nmodule 'vpa_pmu' can be unloaded while one of the perf-events are still\nactive, which can lead to kernel oops and panic of the form below on a\nPseries-LPAR:\n\nBUG: Kernel NULL pointer dereference on read at 0x00000058\n<snip>\n NIP [c000000000506cb8] event_sched_out+0x40/0x258\n LR [c00000000050e8a4] __perf_remove_from_context+0x7c/0x2b0\n Call Trace:\n [c00000025fc3fc30] [c00000025f8457a8] 0xc00000025f8457a8 (unreliable)\n [c00000025fc3fc80] [fffffffffffffee0] 0xfffffffffffffee0\n [c00000025fc3fcd0] [c000000000501e70] event_function+0xa8/0x120\n<snip>\n Kernel panic - not syncing: Aiee, killing interrupt handler!\n\nFix this by adding the module ownership to 'vpa_pmu' so that the module\n'vpa_pmu' is ref-counted and prevented from being unloaded when perf-events\nare initialized."
