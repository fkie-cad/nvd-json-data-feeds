      "value": "The Sencore SMP100 SMP Media Platform (firmware versions V4.2.160, V60.1.4, V60.1.29) is vulnerable to session hijacking due to improper session management on the /UserManagement.html endpoint. Attackers who are on the same network as the victim and have access to the target's logged-in session can access the endpoint and add new users without any authentication. This allows attackers to gain unauthorized access to the system and perform malicious activities."
