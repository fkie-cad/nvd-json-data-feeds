      "value": "(conda) Constructor is a tool which allows constructing an installer for a collection of conda packages. Prior to version 3.11.3, shell installer scripts process the installation prefix (user_prefix) using an eval statement, which executes unsanitized user input as shell code. Although the script runs with user privileges (not root), an attacker could exploit this by injecting arbitrary commands through a malicious path during installation. Exploitation requires explicit user action. This issue has been patched in version 3.11.3."
