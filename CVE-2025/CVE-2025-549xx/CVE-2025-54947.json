      "value": "In Apache StreamPark versions 2.0.0 through 2.1.7, a security vulnerability involving a hard-coded encryption key exists. This vulnerability occurs because the system uses a fixed, immutable key for encryption instead of dynamically generating or securely configuring the key. Attackers may obtain this key through reverse engineering or code analysis, potentially decrypting sensitive data or forging encrypted information, leading to information disclosure or unauthorized system access.\n\nThis issue affects Apache StreamPark: from 2.0.0 before 2.1.7.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 2.1.7, which fixes the issue."
