      "value": "HAX open-apis provides microservice apis for HAX webcomponents repo that are shared infrastructure calls. An unauthenticated information disclosure vulnerability exists in the Penn State University deployment of the HAX content management system via the `haxPsuUsage` API endpoint, related to a flat present in open-apis versions up to and including 10.0.2. This allows any remote unauthenticated user to retrieve a full list of PSU websites hosted on HAX CMS. When chained with other authorization issues (e.g., HAX-3), this could assist in targeted attacks such as unauthorized content modification or deletion. Commit 06c2e1fbb7131a8fe66aa0600f38dcacae6b7ac7 patches the vulnerability."
