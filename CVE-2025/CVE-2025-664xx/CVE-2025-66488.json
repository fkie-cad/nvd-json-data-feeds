While scripts may be executed, they will only be run in the context of the S3/CDN domain, with no site credentials. Versions 3.5.4, 2025.11.2, 2025.12.1, and 2026.1.0 fix the issue. As a workaround, disallow html or xml files for uploads in authorized_extensions. For existing html xml uploads, site owners can consider deleting them."
