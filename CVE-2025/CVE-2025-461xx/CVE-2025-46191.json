Due to the absence of proper file extension checks, MIME type validation, and authentication, attackers can upload executable PHP files to a web-accessible directory (/files/). This allows them to execute arbitrary commands remotely by accessing the uploaded script, resulting in full Remote Code Execution (RCE) without authentication."
