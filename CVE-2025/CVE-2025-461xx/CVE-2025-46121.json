      "value": "An issue was discovered in CommScope Ruckus Unleashed prior to 200.15.6.212.14 and 200.17.7.0.139, where the functions `stamgr_cfg_adpt_addStaFavourite` and `stamgr_cfg_adpt_addStaIot` pass a client hostname directly to snprintf as the format string. A remote attacker can exploit this flaw either by sending a crafted request to the authenticated endpoint `/admin/_conf.jsp`, or without authentication and without direct network access to the controller by spoofing the MAC address of a favourite station and embedding malicious format specifiers in the DHCP hostname field, resulting in unauthenticated format-string processing and arbitrary code execution on the controller."
