      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nASoC: SOF: ipc4-topology: Harden loops for looking up ALH copiers\n\nOther, non DAI copier widgets could have the same  stream name (sname) as\nthe ALH copier and in that case the copier->data is NULL, no alh_data is\nattached, which could lead to NULL pointer dereference.\nWe could check for this NULL pointer in sof_ipc4_prepare_copier_module()\nand avoid the crash, but a similar loop in sof_ipc4_widget_setup_comp_dai()\nwill miscalculate the ALH device count, causing broken audio.\n\nThe correct fix is to harden the matching logic by making sure that the\n1. widget is a DAI widget - so dai = w->private is valid\n2. the dai (and thus the copier) is ALH copier"
