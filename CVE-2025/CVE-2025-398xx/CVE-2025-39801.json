      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: dwc3: Remove WARN_ON for device endpoint command timeouts\n\nThis commit addresses a rarely observed endpoint command timeout\nwhich causes kernel panic due to warn when 'panic_on_warn' is enabled\nand unnecessary call trace prints when 'panic_on_warn' is disabled.\nIt is seen during fast software-controlled connect/disconnect testcases.\nThe following is one such endpoint command timeout that we observed:\n\n1. Connect\n   =======\n->dwc3_thread_interrupt\n ->dwc3_ep0_interrupt\n  ->configfs_composite_setup\n   ->composite_setup\n    ->usb_ep_queue\n     ->dwc3_gadget_ep0_queue\n      ->__dwc3_gadget_ep0_queue\n       ->__dwc3_ep0_do_control_data\n        ->dwc3_send_gadget_ep_cmd\n\n2. Disconnect\n   ==========\n->dwc3_thread_interrupt\n ->dwc3_gadget_disconnect_interrupt\n  ->dwc3_ep0_reset_state\n   ->dwc3_ep0_end_control_data\n    ->dwc3_send_gadget_ep_cmd\n\nIn the issue scenario, in Exynos platforms, we observed that control\ntransfers for the previous connect have not yet been completed and end\ntransfer command sent as a part of the disconnect sequence and\nprocessing of USB_ENDPOINT_HALT feature request from the host timeout.\nThis maybe an expected scenario since the controller is processing EP\ncommands sent as a part of the previous connect. It maybe better to\nremove WARN_ON in all places where device endpoint commands are sent to\navoid unnecessary kernel panic due to warn."
