      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nipv4: Fix reference count leak when using error routes with nexthop objects\n\nWhen a nexthop object is deleted, it is marked as dead and then\nfib_table_flush() is called to flush all the routes that are using the\ndead nexthop.\n\nThe current logic in fib_table_flush() is to only flush error routes\n(e.g., blackhole) when it is called as part of network namespace\ndismantle (i.e., with flush_all=true). Therefore, error routes are not\nflushed when their nexthop object is deleted:\n\n # ip link add name dummy1 up type dummy\n # ip nexthop add id 1 dev dummy1\n # ip route add 198.51.100.1/32 nhid 1\n # ip route add blackhole 198.51.100.2/32 nhid 1\n # ip nexthop del id 1\n # ip route show\n blackhole 198.51.100.2 nhid 1 dev dummy1\n\nAs such, they keep holding a reference on the nexthop object which in\nturn holds a reference on the nexthop device, resulting in a reference\ncount leak:\n\n # ip link del dev dummy1\n [   70.516258] unregister_netdevice: waiting for dummy1 to become free. Usage count = 2\n\nFix by flushing error routes when their nexthop is marked as dead.\n\nIPv6 does not suffer from this problem."
