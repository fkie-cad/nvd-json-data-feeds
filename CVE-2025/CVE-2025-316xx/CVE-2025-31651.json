If those \nrewrite rules effectively enforced security constraints, those \nconstraints could be bypassed.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.5, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.39, from 9.0.0.M1 through 9.0.102.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version [FIXED_VERSION], which fixes the issue."
