      "value": "A stored Cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Mercury MR816v2 (081C3114 4.8.7 Build 110427 Rel 36550n) router allows a remote attacker on the LAN to inject JavaScript into the router's management UI by submitting a malicious hostname. The injected script is stored and later executed in the context of an administrator's browser (for example after DHCP release/renew triggers the interface to display the stored hostname). Because the management interface uses weak/basic authentication and does not properly protect or isolate session material, the XSS can be used to exfiltrate the admin session and perform administrative actions."
