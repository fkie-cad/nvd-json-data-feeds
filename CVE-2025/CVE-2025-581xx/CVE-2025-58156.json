      "value": "Centurion ERP is an ERP with a focus on ITSM and automation. In versions starting from 1.12.0 to before 1.21.0, an authenticated user can view all authentication token details within the database. This includes the actual token, although only the hashed token. This does not include any un-hashed authentication token as viewable. This issue has been patched in version 1.21.0. A workaround for this is not deemed viable as it would involve disabling token authentication. Users are encouraged to remove any authentication token that was created by one of the effected versions of Centurion ERP. Webmasters can ensure this occurs by removing all authentication tokens from the database."
