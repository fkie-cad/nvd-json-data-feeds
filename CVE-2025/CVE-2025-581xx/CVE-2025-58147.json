Xen has boundary checking bugs with all three\nformats, which can cause out-of-bounds reads and writes while processing\nthe inputs.\n\n * CVE-2025-58147.  Hypercalls using the HV_VP_SET Sparse format can\n   cause vpmask_set() to write out of bounds when converting the bitmap\n   to Xen's format.\n\n * CVE-2025-58148.  Hypercalls using any input format can cause\n   send_ipi() to read d->vcpu[] out-of-bounds, and operate on a wild\n   vCPU pointer."
