If it does, it triggers a\nwarning.\n\nThis warning was triggering but after looking at why, it was because\nanother acceptable situation was happening and it wasn't checked for.\n\nIf the reader catches up to the writer and there's still data to be read\non the reader page, then the rb_get_reader_page() will return NULL as\nthere's no new page to get.\n\nIn this situation, the reader page should not be updated and no warning\nshould trigger."
