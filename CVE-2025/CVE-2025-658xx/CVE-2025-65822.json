      "value": "The ESP32 system on a chip (SoC) that powers the Meatmeet Pro was found to have JTAG enabled. By leaving JTAG enabled on an ESP32 in a commercial product an attacker with physical access to the device can connect over this port and reflash the device's firmware with malicious code which will be executed upon running. As a result, the victim will lose access to the functionality of their device and the attack may gain unauthorized access to the victim's Wi-Fi network by re-connecting to the SSID defined in the NVS partition of the device."
