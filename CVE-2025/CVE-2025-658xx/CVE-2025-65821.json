      "value": "As UART download mode is still enabled on the ESP32 chip on which the firmware runs, an adversary can dump the flash from the device and retrieve sensitive information such as details about the current and previous Wi-Fi network from the NVS partition. Additionally, this allows the adversary to reflash the device with their own firmware which may contain malicious modifications."
