      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nxen/events: Return -EEXIST for bound VIRQs\n\nChange find_virq() to return -EEXIST when a VIRQ is bound to a\ndifferent CPU than the one passed in.  With that, remove the BUG_ON()\nfrom bind_virq_to_irq() to propogate the error upwards.\n\nSome VIRQs are per-cpu, but others are per-domain or global.  Those must\nbe bound to CPU0 and can then migrate elsewhere.  The lookup for\nper-domain and global will probably fail when migrated off CPU 0,\nespecially when the current CPU is tracked.  This now returns -EEXIST\ninstead of BUG_ON().\n\nA second call to bind a per-domain or global VIRQ is not expected, but\nmake it non-fatal to avoid trying to look up the irq, since we don't\nknow which per_cpu(virq_to_irq) it will be in."
