      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\next4: verify orphan file size is not too big\n\nIn principle orphan file can be arbitrarily large. However orphan replay\nneeds to traverse it all and we also pin all its buffers in memory. Thus\nfilesystems with absurdly large orphan files can lead to big amounts of\nmemory consumed. Limit orphan file size to a sane value and also use\nkvmalloc() for allocating array of block descriptor structures to avoid\nlarge order allocations for sane but large orphan files."
