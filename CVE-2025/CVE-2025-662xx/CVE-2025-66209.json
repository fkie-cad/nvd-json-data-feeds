Prior to version 4.0.0-beta.451, an authenticated command injection vulnerability in the Database Backup functionality allows users with application/service management permissions to execute arbitrary commands as root on managed servers. Database names used in backup operations are passed directly to shell commands without sanitization, enabling full remote code execution. Version 4.0.0-beta.451 fixes the issue."
