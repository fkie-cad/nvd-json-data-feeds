      "value": "VictoriaMetrics is a scalable solution for monitoring and managing time series data. In versions from 1.0.0 to before 1.110.23, from 1.111.0 to before 1.122.8, and from 1.123.0 to before 1.129.1, affected versions are vulnerable to DoS attacks because the snappy decoder ignored VictoriaMetrics request size limits allowing malformed blocks to trigger excessive memory use. This could lead to OOM errors and service instability. The fix enforces block-size checks based on MaxRequest limits. This issue has been patched in versions 1.110.23, 1.122.8, and 1.129.1."
