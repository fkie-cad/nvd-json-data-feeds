      "value": "pyLoad is a free and open-source Download Manager written in pure Python. In version 0.5.0b3.dev89, an authenticated path traversal vulnerability exists in the /json/upload endpoint of pyLoad. By manipulating the filename of an uploaded file, an attacker can traverse out of the intended upload directory, allowing them to write arbitrary files to any location on the system accessible to the pyLoad process. This may lead to: Remote Code Execution (RCE), local privilege escalation, system-wide compromise, persistence, and backdoors. This is fixed in version 0.5.0b3.dev90."
