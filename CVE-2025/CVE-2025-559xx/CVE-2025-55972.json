      "value": "A TCL Smart TV running a vulnerable UPnP/DLNA MediaRenderer implementation is affected by a remote, unauthenticated Denial of Service (DoS) condition. By sending a flood of malformed or oversized SetAVTransportURI SOAP requests to the UPnP control endpoint, an attacker can cause the device to become unresponsive. This denial persists as long as the attack continues and affects all forms of TV operation. Manual user control and even reboots do not restore functionality unless the flood stops."
