      "value": "SAP NetWeaver Application Server ABAP (BIC Document) allows an authenticated attacker to craft a request that, when submitted to a BIC Document application, could cause a memory corruption error. On successful exploitation, this results in the crash of the target component. Multiple submissions can make the target completely unavailable. A similarly crafted submission can be used to perform an out-of-bounds read operation as well, revealing sensitive information that is loaded in memory at that time. There is no ability to modify any information."
