      "value": "The WP Human Resource Management plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary User Deletion due to a missing authorization within the ajax_delete_employee() function in versions 2.0.0 through 2.2.17. The plugin\u2019s deletion handler reads the client-supplied $_POST['delete'] array and passes each ID directly to wp_delete_user() without verifying that the caller has the delete_users capability or limiting which user IDs may be removed. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Employee-level access and above, to delete arbitrary accounts, including administrators."
