This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the `parseData` function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to export sensitive information including user data, email addresses, password hashes, and WooCommerce data to an attacker-controlled file path on the server via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
