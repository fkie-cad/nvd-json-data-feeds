      "value": "The Single RAN baseband OAM service is intended to run as an unprivileged service. However, it initially starts with root privileges and assigns certain capabilities before dropping to an unprivileged level. The capabilities retained from the root period are considered extensive after the privilege drop and, in theory, could potentially allow actions beyond the intended scope of the OAM service. These actions could include gaining root privileges, accessing root-owned files, modifying them as the file owner, and then returning them to root ownership. This issue has been corrected starting from release 24R1-SR 0.2 MP and later.\n\nBeginning with release 24R1-SR 0.2 MP, the OAM service software capabilities are restricted to the minimum necessary."
