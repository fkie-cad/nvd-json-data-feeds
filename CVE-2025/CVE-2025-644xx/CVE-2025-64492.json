Versions 8.9.0 and below contain a time-based blind SQL Injection vulnerability. This vulnerability allows an authenticated attacker to infer data from the database by measuring response times, potentially leading to the extraction of sensitive information. It is possible for an attacker to enumerate database, table, and column names, extract sensitive data, or escalate privileges. This is fixed in version 8.9.1."
