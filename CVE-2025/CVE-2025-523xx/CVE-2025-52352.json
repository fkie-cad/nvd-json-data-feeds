      "value": "Aikaan IoT management platform v3.25.0325-5-g2e9c59796 provides a configuration to disable user sign-up in distributed deployments by hiding the sign-up option on the login page UI. However, the sign-up API endpoint remains publicly accessible and functional, allowing unauthenticated users to register accounts via APIs even when the feature is disabled. This leads to authentication bypass and unauthorized access to admin portals, violating intended access controls."
