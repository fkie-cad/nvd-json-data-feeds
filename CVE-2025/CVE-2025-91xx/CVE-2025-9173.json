Further investigation showed that it was not a security issue. Notes: The file upload in include/service/media.php verifies the file extension based on a list defined in include/lib/option.php. This whitelist prevents unrestricted uploads (e.g. PHP files). Therefore, the attack possibility is just of theoretical nature."
