      "value": "An issue was discovered on IROAD Dashcam FX2 devices. Bypass of Device Pairing/Registration can occur. It requires device registration via the \"IROAD X View\" app for authentication, but its HTTP server lacks this restriction. Once connected to the dashcam's Wi-Fi network via the default password (\"qwertyuiop\"), an attacker can directly access the HTTP server at http://192.168.10.1 without undergoing the pairing process. Additionally, no alert is triggered on the device when an attacker connects, making this intrusion completely silent."
