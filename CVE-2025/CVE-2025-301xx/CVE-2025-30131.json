      "value": "An issue was discovered on IROAD Dashcam FX2 devices. An unauthenticated file upload endpoint can be leveraged to execute arbitrary commands by uploading a CGI-based webshell. Once a file is uploaded, the attacker can execute commands with root privileges, gaining full control over the dashcam. Additionally, by uploading a netcat (nc) binary, the attacker can establish a reverse shell, maintaining persistent remote and privileged access to the device. This allows complete device takeover."
