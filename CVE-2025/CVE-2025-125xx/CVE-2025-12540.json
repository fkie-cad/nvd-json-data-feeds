This is due to the Google Analytics client_ID and client_secret being stored in plaintext in the publicly visible plugin source. This can allow unauthenticated attackers to craft a link to the sharethis.com server, which will share an authorization token for Google Analytics with a malicious website, if the attacker can trick an administrator logged into the website and Google Analytics to click the link."
