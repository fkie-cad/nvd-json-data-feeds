      "value": "Python JSON Logger is a JSON Formatter for Python Logging. Between 30 December 2024 and 4 March 2025 Python JSON Logger was vulnerable to RCE through a missing dependency. This occurred because msgspec-python313-pre was deleted by the owner leaving the name open to being claimed by a third party. If the package was claimed, it would allow them RCE on any Python JSON Logger user who installed the development dependencies on Python 3.13 (e.g. pip install python-json-logger[dev]). This issue has been resolved with 3.3.0."
