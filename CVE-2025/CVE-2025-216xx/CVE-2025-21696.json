      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm: clear uffd-wp PTE/PMD state on mremap()\n\nWhen mremap()ing a memory region previously registered with userfaultfd as\nwrite-protected but without UFFD_FEATURE_EVENT_REMAP, an inconsistency in\nflag clearing leads to a mismatch between the vma flags (which have\nuffd-wp cleared) and the pte/pmd flags (which do not have uffd-wp\ncleared).  This mismatch causes a subsequent mprotect(PROT_WRITE) to\ntrigger a warning in page_table_check_pte_flags() due to setting the pte\nto writable while uffd-wp is still set.\n\nFix this by always explicitly clearing the uffd-wp pte/pmd flags on any\nsuch mremap() so that the values are consistent with the existing clearing\nof VM_UFFD_WP.  Be careful to clear the logical flag regardless of its\nphysical form; a PTE bit, a swap PTE bit, or a PTE marker.  Cover PTE,\nhuge PMD and hugetlb paths."
