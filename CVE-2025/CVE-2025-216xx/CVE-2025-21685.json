      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nplatform/x86: lenovo-yoga-tab2-pro-1380-fastcharger: fix serdev race\n\nThe yt2_1380_fc_serdev_probe() function calls devm_serdev_device_open()\nbefore setting the client ops via serdev_device_set_client_ops(). This\nordering can trigger a NULL pointer dereference in the serdev controller's\nreceive_buf handler, as it assumes serdev->ops is valid when\nSERPORT_ACTIVE is set.\n\nThis is similar to the issue fixed in commit 5e700b384ec1\n(\"platform/chrome: cros_ec_uart: properly fix race condition\") where\ndevm_serdev_device_open() was called before fully initializing the\ndevice.\n\nFix the race by ensuring client ops are set before enabling the port via\ndevm_serdev_device_open().\n\nNote, serdev_device_set_baudrate() and serdev_device_set_flow_control()\ncalls should be after the devm_serdev_device_open() call."
