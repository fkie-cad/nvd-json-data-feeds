      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvsock: fix lock inversion in vsock_assign_transport()\n\nSyzbot reported a potential lock inversion deadlock between\nvsock_register_mutex and sk_lock-AF_VSOCK when vsock_linger() is called.\n\nThe issue was introduced by commit 687aa0c5581b (\"vsock: Fix\ntransport_* TOCTOU\") which added vsock_register_mutex locking in\nvsock_assign_transport() around the transport->release() call, that can\ncall vsock_linger(). vsock_assign_transport() can be called with sk_lock\nheld. vsock_linger() calls sk_wait_event() that temporarily releases and\nre-acquires sk_lock. During this window, if another thread hold\nvsock_register_mutex while trying to acquire sk_lock, a circular\ndependency is created.\n\nFix this by releasing vsock_register_mutex before calling\ntransport->release() and vsock_deassign_transport(). This is safe\nbecause we don't need to hold vsock_register_mutex while releasing the\nold transport, and we ensure the new transport won't disappear by\nobtaining a module reference first via try_module_get()."
