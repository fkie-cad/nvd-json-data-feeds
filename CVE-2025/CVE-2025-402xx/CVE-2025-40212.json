      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnfsd: fix refcount leak in nfsd_set_fh_dentry()\n\nnfsd exports a \"pseudo root filesystem\" which is used by NFSv4 to find\nthe various exported filesystems using LOOKUP requests from a known root\nfilehandle.  NFSv3 uses the MOUNT protocol to find those exported\nfilesystems and so is not given access to the pseudo root filesystem.\n\nIf a v3 (or v2) client uses a filehandle from that filesystem,\nnfsd_set_fh_dentry() will report an error, but still stores the export\nin \"struct svc_fh\" even though it also drops the reference (exp_put()).\nThis means that when fh_put() is called an extra reference will be dropped\nwhich can lead to use-after-free and possible denial of service.\n\nNormal NFS usage will not provide a pseudo-root filehandle to a v3\nclient.  This bug can only be triggered by the client synthesising an\nincorrect filehandle.\n\nTo fix this we move the assignments to the svc_fh later, after all\npossible error cases have been detected."
