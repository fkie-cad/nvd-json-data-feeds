So instead\nwe should look at the bigger problem, namely \"weird locking/scheduling\"\nof the iavf. The first step to fix that is to remove the crit lock.\nI will followup with a -next series that simplifies scheduling/tasks.\n\nCancel the work without netdev lock (weird unlock+lock scheme),\nto fix the [splat2] (which would be totally ugly if we would kept\nthe crit lock).\n\nExtend protected part of iavf_watchdog_task() to include scheduling\nmore work.\n\nNote that the removed comment in iavf_reset_task() was misplaced,\nit belonged to inside of the removed if condition, so it's gone now.\n\n[splat1] - w/o this patch - The deadlock during VF removal:\n     WARNING: possible circular locking dependency detected\n     sh/3825 is trying to acquire lock:\n      ((work_completion)(&(&adapter->watchdog_task)->work)){+.+.}-{0:0}, at: start_flush_work+0x1a1/0x470\n          but task is already holding lock:\n      (&adapter->crit_lock){+.+.}-{4:4}, at: iavf_remove+0xd1/0x690 [iavf]\n          which lock already depends on the new lock.\n\n[splat2] - when cancelling work under crit lock, w/o this series,\n\t   see [2] for the band aid attempt\n    WARNING: possible circular locking dependency detected\n    sh/3550 is trying to acquire lock:\n    ((wq_completion)iavf){+.+.}-{0:0}, at: touch_wq_lockdep_map+0x26/0x90\n        but task is already holding lock:\n    (&dev->lock){+.+.}-{4:4}, at: iavf_remove+0xa6/0x6e0 [iavf]\n        which lock already depends on the new lock.\n\n[1] fc2e6b3b132a (\"iavf: Rework mutexes for better synchronisation\")\n[2] https://github.com/pkitszel/linux/commit/52dddbfc2bb60294083f5711a158a"
