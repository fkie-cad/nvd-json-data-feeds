      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvirtio-pci: Fix result size returned for the admin command completion\n\nThe result size returned by virtio_pci_admin_dev_parts_get() is 8 bytes\nlarger than the actual result data size. This occurs because the\nresult_sg_size field of the command is filled with the result length\nfrom virtqueue_get_buf(), which includes both the data size and an\nadditional 8 bytes of status.\n\nThis oversized result size causes two issues:\n1. The state transferred to the destination includes 8 bytes of extra\n   data at the end.\n2. The allocated buffer in the kernel may be smaller than the returned\n   size, leading to failures when reading beyond the allocated size.\n\nThe commit fixes this by subtracting the status size from the result of\nvirtqueue_get_buf().\n\nThis fix has been tested through live migrations with virtio-net,\nvirtio-net-transitional, and virtio-blk devices."
