However, if we abort the probe\nquite early then during unwind we might try to destroy the workqueue\nwhile there is still a pending delayed work that attempts to restart\nitself which triggers a WARN.\n\nThis was recently observed during unsuccessful VF initialization:\n\n [ ] xe 0000:00:02.1: probe with driver xe failed with error -62\n [ ] ------------[ cut here ]------------\n [ ] workqueue: cannot queue safe_mode_worker_func [xe] on wq xe-g2h-wq\n [ ] WARNING: CPU: 9 PID: 0 at kernel/workqueue.c:2257 __queue_work+0x287/0x710\n [ ] RIP: 0010:__queue_work+0x287/0x710\n [ ] Call Trace:\n [ ]  delayed_work_timer_fn+0x19/0x30\n [ ]  call_timer_fn+0xa1/0x2a0\n\nExit the CT safe mode on unwind to avoid that warning.\n\n(cherry picked from commit 2ddbb73ec20b98e70a5200cb85deade22ccea2ec)"
