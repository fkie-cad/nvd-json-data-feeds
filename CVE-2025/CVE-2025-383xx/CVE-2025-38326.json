This queue was added as\npart of the conversion to blk_mq. However, the queue was not cleaned out\nwhen an aoe device is downed which caused blk_mq_freeze_queue() to sleep\nindefinitely waiting for those requests to complete, causing a hang. This\nfix cleans out the queue before calling blk_mq_freeze_queue()."
