This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information or to create a denial-of-service condition on affected installations of Marvell QConvergeConsole. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the implementation of the compressConfigFiles method. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path prior to using it in file operations. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to disclose sensitive information or to create a denial-of-service condition on the system. Was ZDI-CAN-24915."
