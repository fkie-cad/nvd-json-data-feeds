      "value": "FontForge SFD File Parsing Improper Validation of Array Index Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of FontForge. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing of SFD files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a write past the end of an allocated array. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current user. Was ZDI-CAN-28562."
