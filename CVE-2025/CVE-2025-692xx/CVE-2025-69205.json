In versions up to and including commit 88db9a953f38a3026bcd6816d51c7f3b93c55893, an attacker can crafts a special federation name and characters treated special by asterisk can be injected into the `Dial( )` application due to improper input validation. This allows an attacker to redirect calls on both of the federating instances. If the attack succeeds, the impact is very high. However, the requires that an admin accept the federation requests. As of time of publication, a known patched version of \u00b5URU is not available."
