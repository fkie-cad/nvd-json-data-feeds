      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nRevert \"riscv: Define TASK_SIZE_MAX for __access_ok()\"\n\nThis reverts commit ad5643cf2f69 (\"riscv: Define TASK_SIZE_MAX for\n__access_ok()\").\n\nThis commit changes TASK_SIZE_MAX to be LONG_MAX to optimize access_ok(),\nbecause the previous TASK_SIZE_MAX (default to TASK_SIZE) requires some\ncomputation.\n\nThe reasoning was that all user addresses are less than LONG_MAX, and all\nkernel addresses are greater than LONG_MAX. Therefore access_ok() can\nfilter kernel addresses.\n\nAddresses between TASK_SIZE and LONG_MAX are not valid user addresses, but\naccess_ok() let them pass. That was thought to be okay, because they are\nnot valid addresses at hardware level.\n\nUnfortunately, one case is missed: get_user_pages_fast() happily accepts\naddresses between TASK_SIZE and LONG_MAX. futex(), for instance, uses\nget_user_pages_fast(). This causes the problem reported by Robert [1].\n\nTherefore, revert this commit. TASK_SIZE_MAX is changed to the default:\nTASK_SIZE.\n\nThis unfortunately reduces performance, because TASK_SIZE is more expensive\nto compute compared to LONG_MAX. But correctness first, we can think about\noptimization later, if required."
