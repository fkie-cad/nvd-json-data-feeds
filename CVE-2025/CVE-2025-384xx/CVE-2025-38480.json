      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncomedi: Fix use of uninitialized data in insn_rw_emulate_bits()\n\nFor Comedi `INSN_READ` and `INSN_WRITE` instructions on \"digital\"\nsubdevices (subdevice types `COMEDI_SUBD_DI`, `COMEDI_SUBD_DO`, and\n`COMEDI_SUBD_DIO`), it is common for the subdevice driver not to have\n`insn_read` and `insn_write` handler functions, but to have an\n`insn_bits` handler function for handling Comedi `INSN_BITS`\ninstructions.  In that case, the subdevice's `insn_read` and/or\n`insn_write` function handler pointers are set to point to the\n`insn_rw_emulate_bits()` function by `__comedi_device_postconfig()`.\n\nFor `INSN_WRITE`, `insn_rw_emulate_bits()` currently assumes that the\nsupplied `data[0]` value is a valid copy from user memory.  It will at\nleast exist because `do_insnlist_ioctl()` and `do_insn_ioctl()` in\n\"comedi_fops.c\" ensure at lease `MIN_SAMPLES` (16) elements are\nallocated.  However, if `insn->n` is 0 (which is allowable for\n`INSN_READ` and `INSN_WRITE` instructions, then `data[0]` may contain\nuninitialized data, and certainly contains invalid data, possibly from a\ndifferent instruction in the array of instructions handled by\n`do_insnlist_ioctl()`.  This will result in an incorrect value being\nwritten to the digital output channel (or to the digital input/output\nchannel if configured as an output), and may be reflected in the\ninternal saved state of the channel.\n\nFix it by returning 0 early if `insn->n` is 0, before reaching the code\nthat accesses `data[0]`.  Previously, the function always returned 1 on\nsuccess, but it is supposed to be the number of data samples actually\nread or written up to `insn->n`, which is 0 in this case."
