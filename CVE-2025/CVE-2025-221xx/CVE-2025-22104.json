If the buffer\nsize was not a multiple of 8 then a read buffer overflow was possible.\n\nTherefore, create a new ibmvnic function that loops over a buffer and\ncalls hex_dump_to_buffer instead.\n\nThis patch address KASAN reports like the one below:\n  ibmvnic 30000003 env3: Login Buffer:\n  ibmvnic 30000003 env3: 01000000af000000\n  <...>\n  ibmvnic 30000003 env3: 2e6d62692e736261\n  ibmvnic 30000003 env3: 65050003006d6f63\n  ==================================================================\n  BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in ibmvnic_login+0xacc/0xffc [ibmvnic]\n  Read of size 8 at addr c0000001331a9aa8 by task ip/17681\n  <...>\n  Allocated by task 17681:\n  <...>\n  ibmvnic_login+0x2f0/0xffc [ibmvnic]\n  ibmvnic_open+0x148/0x308 [ibmvnic]\n  __dev_open+0x1ac/0x304\n  <...>\n  The buggy address is located 168 bytes inside of\n                allocated 175-byte region [c0000001331a9a00, c0000001331a9aaf)\n  <...>\n  =================================================================\n  ibmvnic 30000003 env3: 000000000033766e"
