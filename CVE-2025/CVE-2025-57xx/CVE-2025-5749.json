      "value": "WOLFBOX Level 2 EV Charger BLE Encryption Keys Uninitialized Variable Authentication Bypass Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to bypass authentication on affected installations of WOLFBOX Level 2 EV Charger devices. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of cryptographic keys used in vendor-specific encrypted communications. The issue results from the lack of proper initialization of a variable prior to accessing it. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to bypass authentication on the system. Was ZDI-CAN-26295."
