      "value": "Apollo Router Core is a configurable graph router written in Rust to run a federated supergraph using Apollo Federation 2. In versions 1.61.11 below, as well as 2.0.0-alpha.0 through 2.8.1-rc.0, a vulnerability allowed for unauthenticated queries to access data that required additional access controls. Router incorrectly handled access control directives on interface types/fields and their implementing object types/fields, applying them to interface types/fields while ignoring directives on their implementing object types/fields when all implementations had the same requirements. Apollo Router customers defining @authenticated, @requiresScopes, or @policy directives inconsistently on polymorphic types (i.e., object types that implement interface types) are impacted. This issue is fixed in versions 1.61.12 and 2.8.1."
