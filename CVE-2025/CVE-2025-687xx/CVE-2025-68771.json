      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nocfs2: fix kernel BUG in ocfs2_find_victim_chain\n\nsyzbot reported a kernel BUG in ocfs2_find_victim_chain() because the\n`cl_next_free_rec` field of the allocation chain list (next free slot in\nthe chain list) is 0, triggring the BUG_ON(!cl->cl_next_free_rec)\ncondition in ocfs2_find_victim_chain() and panicking the kernel.\n\nTo fix this, an if condition is introduced in ocfs2_claim_suballoc_bits(),\njust before calling ocfs2_find_victim_chain(), the code block in it being\nexecuted when either of the following conditions is true:\n\n1. `cl_next_free_rec` is equal to 0, indicating that there are no free\nchains in the allocation chain list\n2. `cl_next_free_rec` is greater than `cl_count` (the total number of\nchains in the allocation chain list)\n\nEither of them being true is indicative of the fact that there are no\nchains left for usage.\n\nThis is addressed using ocfs2_error(), which prints\nthe error log for debugging purposes, rather than panicking the kernel."
