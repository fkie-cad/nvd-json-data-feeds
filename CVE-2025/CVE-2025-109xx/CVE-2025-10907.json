A malicious actor with administrative privileges can upload a specially crafted file to a user-controlled location within the deployment.\n\nSuccessful exploitation may lead to remote code execution (RCE) on the server, depending on how the uploaded file is processed. By default, this vulnerability is only exploitable by users with administrative access to the affected SOAP services."
