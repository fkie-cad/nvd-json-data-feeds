      "value": "Paramount Macrium Reflect through 2025-06-26 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code with administrator privileges via a crafted .mrimgx or .mrbax backup file and a renamed executable placed in the same directory. When a user with administrative privileges opens the crafted backup file and proceeds to mount it, Reflect launches the renamed executable (e.g., explorer.exe), which is under attacker control. This occurs because of insufficient validation of companion files referenced during backup mounting."
