This issue occurs during user authentication process, where a difference in response time could allow a remote unauthenticated user to determine if a username is valid or not.  This only applies to deprecated basic-authentication feature and other more secure authentication mechanisms are recommended.

Please note:  Basic credentials authentication service type is deprecated started in 24.2 version:  https://docs.pega.com/bundle/platform/page/platform/release-notes/security/whats-new-security-242.html."
