      "value": "Local Deep Research is an AI-powered research assistant for deep, iterative research. In versions from 1.3.0 to before 1.3.9, the download service (download_service.py) makes HTTP requests using raw requests.get() without utilizing the application's SSRF protection (safe_requests.py). This can allow attackers to access internal services and attempt to reach cloud provider metadata endpoints (AWS/GCP/Azure), as well as perform internal network reconnaissance, by submitting malicious URLs through the API, depending on the deployment and surrounding controls. This issue has been patched in version 1.3.9."
