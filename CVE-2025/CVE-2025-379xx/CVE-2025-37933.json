      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nocteon_ep: Fix host hang issue during device reboot\n\nWhen the host loses heartbeat messages from the device,\nthe driver calls the device-specific ndo_stop function,\nwhich frees the resources. If the driver is unloaded in\nthis scenario, it calls ndo_stop again, attempting to free\nresources that have already been freed, leading to a host\nhang issue. To resolve this, dev_close should be called\ninstead of the device-specific stop function.dev_close\ninternally calls ndo_stop to stop the network interface\nand performs additional cleanup tasks. During the driver\nunload process, if the device is already down, ndo_stop\nis not called."
