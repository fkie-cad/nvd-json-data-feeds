      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: rainshadow-cec: fix TOCTOU race condition in rain_interrupt()\n\nIn the interrupt handler rain_interrupt(), the buffer full check on\nrain->buf_len is performed before acquiring rain->buf_lock. This\ncreates a Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition, as\nrain->buf_len is concurrently accessed and modified in the work\nhandler rain_irq_work_handler() under the same lock.\n\nMultiple interrupt invocations can race, with each reading buf_len\nbefore it becomes full and then proceeding. This can lead to both\ninterrupts attempting to write to the buffer, incrementing buf_len\nbeyond its capacity (DATA_SIZE) and causing a buffer overflow.\n\nFix this bug by moving the spin_lock() to before the buffer full\ncheck. This ensures that the check and the subsequent buffer modification\nare performed atomically, preventing the race condition. An corresponding\nspin_unlock() is added to the overflow path to correctly release the\nlock.\n\nThis possible bug was found by an experimental static analysis tool\ndeveloped by our team."
