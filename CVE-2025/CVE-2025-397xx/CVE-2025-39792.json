      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndm: Always split write BIOs to zoned device limits\n\nAny zoned DM target that requires zone append emulation will use the\nblock layer zone write plugging. In such case, DM target drivers must\nnot split BIOs using dm_accept_partial_bio() as doing so can potentially\nlead to deadlocks with queue freeze operations. Regular write operations\nused to emulate zone append operations also cannot be split by the\ntarget driver as that would result in an invalid writen sector value\nreturn using the BIO sector.\n\nIn order for zoned DM target drivers to avoid such incorrect BIO\nsplitting, we must ensure that large BIOs are split before being passed\nto the map() function of the target, thus guaranteeing that the\nlimits for the mapped device are not exceeded.\n\ndm-crypt and dm-flakey are the only target drivers supporting zoned\ndevices and using dm_accept_partial_bio().\n\nIn the case of dm-crypt, this function is used to split BIOs to the\ninternal max_write_size limit (which will be suppressed in a different\npatch). However, since crypt_alloc_buffer() uses a bioset allowing only\nup to BIO_MAX_VECS (256) vectors in a BIO. The dm-crypt device\nmax_segments limit, which is not set and so default to BLK_MAX_SEGMENTS\n(128), must thus be respected and write BIOs split accordingly.\n\nIn the case of dm-flakey, since zone append emulation is not required,\nthe block layer zone write plugging is not used and no splitting of BIOs\nrequired.\n\nModify the function dm_zone_bio_needs_split() to use the block layer\nhelper function bio_needs_zone_write_plugging() to force a call to\nbio_split_to_limits() in dm_split_and_process_bio(). This allows DM\ntarget drivers to avoid using dm_accept_partial_bio() for write\noperations on zoned DM devices."
