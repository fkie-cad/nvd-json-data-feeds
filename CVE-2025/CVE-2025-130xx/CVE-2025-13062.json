      "value": "The Supreme Modules Lite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file upload in all versions up to, and including, 2.5.62. This is due to insufficient file type validation detecting JSON files, allowing double extension files to bypass sanitization while being accepted as a valid JSON file. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible."
