A Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability exists in versions prior to 2025-07 in the notification template system used by mailcow for sending quota and quarantine alerts. The template rendering engine allows template expressions that may be abused to execute code in certain contexts. The issue requires admin-level access to mailcow UI to configure templates, which are automatically rendered during normal system operation. Version 2025-07 contains a patch for the issue."
