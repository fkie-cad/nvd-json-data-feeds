For example, in the \u201cOther\u201d field of the Instant Messaging section. If another user imported the address book, clicking on the link could result in opening a web page inside Thunderbird, and that page could execute (unprivileged) JavaScript. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 128.7."
