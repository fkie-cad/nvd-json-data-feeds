      "value": "The Chassis Management Board in Entrust nShield Connect XC, nShield 5c, and nShield HSMi through 13.6.11, or 13.7, allows a physically proximate attacker to persistently modify firmware and influence the (insecurely configured) appliance boot process. To exploit this, the attacker must modify the firmware via JTAG or perform an upgrade to the chassis management board firmware. This is called F03."
