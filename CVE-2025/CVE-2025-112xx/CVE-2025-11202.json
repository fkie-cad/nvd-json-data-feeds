This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of win-cli-mcp-server. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the implementation of the resolveCommandPath method. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the service account. Was ZDI-CAN-27787."
