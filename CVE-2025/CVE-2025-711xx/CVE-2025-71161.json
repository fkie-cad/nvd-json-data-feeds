      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndm-verity: disable recursive forward error correction\n\nThere are two problems with the recursive correction:\n\n1. It may cause denial-of-service. In fec_read_bufs, there is a loop that\nhas 253 iterations. For each iteration, we may call verity_hash_for_block\nrecursively. There is a limit of 4 nested recursions - that means that\nthere may be at most 253^4 (4 billion) iterations. Red Hat QE team\nactually created an image that pushes dm-verity to this limit - and this\nimage just makes the udev-worker process get stuck in the 'D' state.\n\n2. It doesn't work. In fec_read_bufs we store data into the variable\n\"fio->bufs\", but fio bufs is shared between recursive invocations, if\n\"verity_hash_for_block\" invoked correction recursively, it would\noverwrite partially filled fio->bufs."
