Subsequent\nattempts to send remaining fragments will therefore result in a\nuse-after-free.\n\nAllocate a temporary RPC container for holding the initial fragment of a\nlarge RPC when sending. Free the caller's container when all fragments\nare successfully sent.\n\n[ Rebase onto Blackwell changes. - Danilo ]"
