      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndm: fix dm_blk_report_zones\n\nIf dm_get_live_table() returned NULL, dm_put_live_table() was never\ncalled. Also, it is possible that md->zone_revalidate_map will change\nwhile calling this function. Only read it once, so that we are always\nusing the same value. Otherwise we might miss a call to\ndm_put_live_table().\n\nFinally, while md->zone_revalidate_map is set and a process is calling\nblk_revalidate_disk_zones() to set up the zone append emulation\nresources, it is possible that another process, perhaps triggered by\nblkdev_report_zones_ioctl(), will call dm_blk_report_zones(). If\nblk_revalidate_disk_zones() fails, these resources can be freed while\nthe other process is still using them, causing a use-after-free error.\n\nblk_revalidate_disk_zones() will only ever be called when initially\nsetting up the zone append emulation resources, such as when setting up\na zoned dm-crypt table for the first time. Further table swaps will not\nset md->zone_revalidate_map or call blk_revalidate_disk_zones().\nHowever it must be called using the new table (referenced by\nmd->zone_revalidate_map) and the new queue limits while the DM device is\nsuspended. dm_blk_report_zones() needs some way to distinguish between a\ncall from blk_revalidate_disk_zones(), which must be allowed to use\nmd->zone_revalidate_map to access this not yet activated table, and all\nother calls to dm_blk_report_zones(), which should not be allowed while\nthe device is suspended and cannot use md->zone_revalidate_map, since\nthe zone resources might be freed by the process currently calling\nblk_revalidate_disk_zones().\n\nSolve this by tracking the process that sets md->zone_revalidate_map in\ndm_revalidate_zones() and only allowing that process to make use of it\nin dm_blk_report_zones()."
