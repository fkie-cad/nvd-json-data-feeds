This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Marvell QConvergeConsole. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the implementation of the saveAsText method. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path prior to using it in file operations. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of SYSTEM. Was ZDI-CAN-24913."
