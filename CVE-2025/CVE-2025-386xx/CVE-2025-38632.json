      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npinmux: fix race causing mux_owner NULL with active mux_usecount\n\ncommit 5a3e85c3c397 (\"pinmux: Use sequential access to access\ndesc->pinmux data\") tried to address the issue when two client of the\nsame gpio calls pinctrl_select_state() for the same functionality, was\nresulting in NULL pointer issue while accessing desc->mux_owner.\nHowever, issue was not completely fixed due to the way it was handled\nand it can still result in the same NULL pointer.\n\nThe issue occurs due to the following interleaving:\n\n     cpu0 (process A)                   cpu1 (process B)\n\n      pin_request() {                   pin_free() {\n\n                                         mutex_lock()\n                                         desc->mux_usecount--; //becomes 0\n                                         ..\n                                         mutex_unlock()\n\n  mutex_lock(desc->mux)\n  desc->mux_usecount++; // becomes 1\n  desc->mux_owner = owner;\n  mutex_unlock(desc->mux)\n\n                                         mutex_lock(desc->mux)\n                                         desc->mux_owner = NULL;\n                                         mutex_unlock(desc->mux)\n\nThis sequence leads to a state where the pin appears to be in use\n(`mux_usecount == 1`) but has no owner (`mux_owner == NULL`), which can\ncause NULL pointer on next pin_request on the same pin.\n\nEnsure that updates to mux_usecount and mux_owner are performed\natomically under the same lock. Only clear mux_owner when mux_usecount\nreaches zero and no new owner has been assigned."
