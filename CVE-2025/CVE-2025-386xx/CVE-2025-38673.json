The field becomes NULL when user space\nreleases the final GEM handle on the buffer object. This resulted\nin a NULL-pointer deref.\n\nWorkarounds in commit 5307dce878d4 (\"drm/gem: Acquire references on\nGEM handles for framebuffers\") and commit f6bfc9afc751 (\"drm/framebuffer:\nAcquire internal references on GEM handles\") only solved the problem\npartially. They especially don't work for buffer objects without a DRM\nframebuffer associated.\n\nHence, this revert to going back to using .import_attach->dmabuf.\n\nv3:\n- cc stable"
