Such strings are literals and\nreading 32 bytes ends up in out of bound memory accesses (e.g. the next\nautomaton's data in this case).\nThe error is harmless as, while printing the string, we stop at the null\nterminator, but it should still be fixed.\n\nUse the __string facilities while defining the tracepoints to avoid\nreading out of bound memory."
