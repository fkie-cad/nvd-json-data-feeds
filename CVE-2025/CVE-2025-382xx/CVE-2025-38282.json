      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nkernfs: Relax constraint in draining guard\n\nThe active reference lifecycle provides the break/unbreak mechanism but\nthe active reference is not truly active after unbreak -- callers don't\nuse it afterwards but it's important for proper pairing of kn->active\ncounting. Assuming this mechanism is in place, the WARN check in\nkernfs_should_drain_open_files() is too sensitive -- it may transiently\ncatch those (rightful) callers between\nkernfs_unbreak_active_protection() and kernfs_put_active() as found out by Chen\nRidong:\n\n\tkernfs_remove_by_name_ns\tkernfs_get_active // active=1\n\t__kernfs_remove\t\t\t\t\t  // active=0x80000002\n\tkernfs_drain\t\t\t...\n\twait_event\n\t//waiting (active == 0x80000001)\n\t\t\t\t\tkernfs_break_active_protection\n\t\t\t\t\t// active = 0x80000001\n\t// continue\n\t\t\t\t\tkernfs_unbreak_active_protection\n\t\t\t\t\t// active = 0x80000002\n\t...\n\tkernfs_should_drain_open_files\n\t// warning occurs\n\t\t\t\t\tkernfs_put_active\n\nTo avoid the false positives (mind panic_on_warn) remove the check altogether.\n(This is meant as quick fix, I think active reference break/unbreak may be\nsimplified with larger rework.)"
