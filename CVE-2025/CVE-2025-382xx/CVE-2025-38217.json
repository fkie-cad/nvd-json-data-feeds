      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nhwmon: (ftsteutates) Fix TOCTOU race in fts_read()\n\nIn the fts_read() function, when handling hwmon_pwm_auto_channels_temp,\nthe code accesses the shared variable data->fan_source[channel] twice\nwithout holding any locks. It is first checked against\nFTS_FAN_SOURCE_INVALID, and if the check passes, it is read again\nwhen used as an argument to the BIT() macro.\n\nThis creates a Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition.\nAnother thread executing fts_update_device() can modify the value of\ndata->fan_source[channel] between the check and its use. If the value\nis changed to FTS_FAN_SOURCE_INVALID (0xff) during this window, the\nBIT() macro will be called with a large shift value (BIT(255)).\nA bit shift by a value greater than or equal to the type width is\nundefined behavior and can lead to a crash or incorrect values being\nreturned to userspace.\n\nFix this by reading data->fan_source[channel] into a local variable\nonce, eliminating the race condition. Additionally, add a bounds check\nto ensure the value is less than BITS_PER_LONG before passing it to\nthe BIT() macro, making the code more robust against undefined behavior.\n\nThis possible bug was found by an experimental static analysis tool\ndeveloped by our team."
