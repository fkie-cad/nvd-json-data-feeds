      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nALSA: usb-audio: Fix out-of-bounds read in snd_usb_get_audioformat_uac3()\n\nIn snd_usb_get_audioformat_uac3(), the length value returned from\nsnd_usb_ctl_msg() is used directly for memory allocation without\nvalidation. This length is controlled by the USB device.\n\nThe allocated buffer is cast to a uac3_cluster_header_descriptor\nand its fields are accessed without verifying that the buffer\nis large enough. If the device returns a smaller than expected\nlength, this leads to an out-of-bounds read.\n\nAdd a length check to ensure the buffer is large enough for\nuac3_cluster_header_descriptor."
