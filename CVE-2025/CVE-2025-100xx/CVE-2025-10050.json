      "value": "The Developer Loggers for Simple History plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 0.5 via the enabled_loggers parameter. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary .php files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where .php file types can be uploaded and included."
