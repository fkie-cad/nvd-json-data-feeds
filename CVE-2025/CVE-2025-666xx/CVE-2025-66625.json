      "value": "Umbraco is an ASP.NET CMS. Due to unsafe handling and deletion of temporary files in versions 10.0.0 through 13.12.0, during the dictionary upload process an attacker with access to the backoffice can trigger predictable requests to temporary file paths. The application\u2019s error responses (HTTP 500 when a file exists, 404 when it does not) allow the attacker to enumerate the existence of arbitrary files on the server\u2019s filesystem. This vulnerability does not allow reading or writing file contents. In certain configurations, incomplete clean-up of temporary upload files may additionally expose the NTLM hash of the Windows account running the Umbraco application. This issue is fixed in version 13.12.1."
