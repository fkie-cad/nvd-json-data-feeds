Attackers were able to confuse the parent process into leaking handles into unpriviled child processes leading to a sandbox escape. \nThe original vulnerability was being exploited in the wild. \n*This only affects Firefox on Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected.* This vulnerability affects Firefox < 136.0.4, Firefox ESR < 128.8.1, and Firefox ESR < 115.21.1."
