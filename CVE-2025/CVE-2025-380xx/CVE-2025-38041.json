Currently any attempt to do device DVFS on the GPU lead\nto panfrost various ooops, and GPU hangs.\n\nThe manual describes the algorithm for changing the PLL\nfrequency, which the CPU PLL notifier code already support, so we reuse\nthat to reparent the GPU clock to GPU1 clock during frequency\nchanges."
