However, due to recent refactoring\nthe gt->mmio is initialized later, and any attempt by the VF to use\nxe_mmio_read|write() from GuC functions will lead to NPD crash due\nto unset MMIO register address:\n\n[] xe 0000:00:02.1: [drm] Running in SR-IOV VF mode\n[] xe 0000:00:02.1: [drm] GT0: sending H2G MMIO 0x5507\n[] BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: 0000000000190240\n\nSince we are already tweaking the id and type of the primary GT to\nmimic it's a Media GT before initializing the GuC communication,\nwe can also call xe_gt_mmio_init() to perform early setup of the\ngt->mmio which will make those GuC functions work again."
