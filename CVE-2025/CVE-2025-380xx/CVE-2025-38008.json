      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/page_alloc: fix race condition in unaccepted memory handling\n\nThe page allocator tracks the number of zones that have unaccepted memory\nusing static_branch_enc/dec() and uses that static branch in hot paths to\ndetermine if it needs to deal with unaccepted memory.\n\nBorislav and Thomas pointed out that the tracking is racy: operations on\nstatic_branch are not serialized against adding/removing unaccepted pages\nto/from the zone.\n\nSanity checks inside static_branch machinery detects it:\n\nWARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 10 at kernel/jump_label.c:276 __static_key_slow_dec_cpuslocked+0x8e/0xa0\n\nThe comment around the WARN() explains the problem:\n\n\t/*\n\t * Warn about the '-1' case though; since that means a\n\t * decrement is concurrent with a first (0->1) increment. IOW\n\t * people are trying to disable something that wasn't yet fully\n\t * enabled. This suggests an ordering problem on the user side.\n\t */\n\nThe effect of this static_branch optimization is only visible on\nmicrobenchmark.\n\nInstead of adding more complexity around it, remove it altogether."
