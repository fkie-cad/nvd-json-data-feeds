      "value": "The Migration, Backup, Staging \u2013 WPvivid plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 0.9.107 via deserialization of untrusted input in the 'replace_row_data' and 'replace_serialize_data' functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code. An administrator must create a staging site to trigger the exploit."
