This weakness could result in the application becoming compromised, leading to unauthorized entries or data poisoning attacks, which are delivered by a CSRF vulnerability due to the absence of a secure session management implementation and weak CORS policies weakness.\u00a0An attacker can direct a user to a malicious webpage that exploits a CSRF vulnerability within the EmbedAI application. By leveraging this CSRF vulnerability, the attacker can deceive the user into inadvertently uploading and integrating incorrect data into the application\u2019s language model."
