      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: do not BUG_ON() when freeing tree block after error\n\nWhen freeing a tree block, at btrfs_free_tree_block(), if we fail to\ncreate a delayed reference we don't deal with the error and just do a\nBUG_ON(). The error most likely to happen is -ENOMEM, and we have a\ncomment mentioning that only -ENOMEM can happen, but that is not true,\nbecause in case qgroups are enabled any error returned from\nbtrfs_qgroup_trace_extent_post() (can be -EUCLEAN or anything returned\nfrom btrfs_search_slot() for example) can be propagated back to\nbtrfs_free_tree_block().\n\nSo stop doing a BUG_ON() and return the error to the callers and make\nthem abort the transaction to prevent leaking space. Syzbot was\ntriggering this, likely due to memory allocation failure injection."
