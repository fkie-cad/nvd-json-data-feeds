But the connector\nstill refers to it, so this cleanup leaves behind a stale pointer\nin struct drm_connector.ddc.\n\nBind the lifetime of the I2C adapter to the connector's lifetime by\nusing DRM's managed release. When the DRM device goes away (after\nthe Linux device) DRM will first clean up the connector and then\nclean up the I2C adapter."
