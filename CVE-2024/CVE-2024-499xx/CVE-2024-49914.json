The issue could occur when\n`pipe_ctx->plane_state` is null.\n\nThe fix adds a check to ensure `pipe_ctx->plane_state` is not null\nbefore accessing. This prevents a null pointer dereference.\n\nReported by smatch:\ndrivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/hwss/dcn20/dcn20_hwseq.c:1925 dcn20_program_pipe() error: we previously assumed 'pipe_ctx->plane_state' could be null (see line 1877)"
