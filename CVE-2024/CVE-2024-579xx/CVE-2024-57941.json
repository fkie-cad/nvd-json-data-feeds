      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetfs: Fix the (non-)cancellation of copy when cache is temporarily disabled\n\nWhen the caching for a cookie is temporarily disabled (e.g. due to a DIO\nwrite on that file), future copying to the cache for that file is disabled\nuntil all fds open on that file are closed.  However, if netfslib is using\nthe deprecated PG_private_2 method (such as is currently used by ceph), and\ndecides it wants to copy to the cache, netfs_advance_write() will just bail\nat the first check seeing that the cache stream is unavailable, and\nindicate that it dealt with all the content.\n\nThis means that we have no subrequests to provide notifications to drive\nthe state machine or even to pin the request and the request just gets\ndiscarded, leaving the folios with PG_private_2 set.\n\nFix this by jumping directly to cancel the request if the cache is not\navailable.  That way, we don't remove mark3 from the folio_queue list and\nnetfs_pgpriv2_cancel() will clean up the folios.\n\nThis was found by running the generic/013 xfstest against ceph with an\nactive cache and the \"-o fsc\" option passed to ceph.  That would usually\nhang"
