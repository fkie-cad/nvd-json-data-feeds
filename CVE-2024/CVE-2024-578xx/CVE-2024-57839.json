The problem has been bisected to\n7c877586da3 (\"readahead: properly shorten readahead when falling back to\ndo_page_cache_ra()\").  The cause of the problem is that ra->size can be\nshrunk by read_pages() call and subsequently we end up calling\ndo_page_cache_ra() with negative (read huge positive) number of pages. \nLet's revert 7c877586da3 for now until we can find a proper way how the\nlogic in read_pages() and page_cache_ra_order() can coexist.  This can\nlead to reduced readahead throughput due to readahead window confusion but\nthat's better than outright hangs."
