Prior to pseudoversion `v0.0.0-20240729232818-a2a9c4f`, which corresponds with commit `a2a9c4f76ef5a5c32108e36f7c47f8d310322252`, there was a logical problem in the paragraph function of the parser/block.go file, which allowed a remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition by providing a tailor-made input that caused an infinite loop, causing the program to hang and consume resources indefinitely. Submit `a2a9c4f76ef5a5c32108e36f7c47f8d310322252` contains fixes to this problem."
