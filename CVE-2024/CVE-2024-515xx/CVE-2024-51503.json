In certain circumstances, attackers that have legitimate access to the domain may be able to remotely inject commands to other machines in the same domain.\r\n\r\nPlease note: an attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability locally and must have domain user privileges to affect other machines."
