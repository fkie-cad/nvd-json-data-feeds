      "value": "An incorrect authorization vulnerability exists in multiple WSO2 products due to a flaw in the SOAP admin service, which allows user account creation regardless of the self-registration configuration settings. This vulnerability enables malicious actors to create new user accounts without proper authorization.\n\nExploitation of this flaw could allow an attacker to create multiple low-privileged user accounts, gaining unauthorized access to the system. Additionally, continuous exploitation could lead to system resource exhaustion through mass user creation."
