      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetfilter: nf_tables: do not defer rule destruction via call_rcu\n\nnf_tables_chain_destroy can sleep, it can't be used from call_rcu\ncallbacks.\n\nMoreover, nf_tables_rule_release() is only safe for error unwinding,\nwhile transaction mutex is held and the to-be-desroyed rule was not\nexposed to either dataplane or dumps, as it deactives+frees without\nthe required synchronize_rcu() in-between.\n\nnft_rule_expr_deactivate() callbacks will change ->use counters\nof other chains/sets, see e.g. nft_lookup .deactivate callback, these\nmust be serialized via transaction mutex.\n\nAlso add a few lockdep asserts to make this more explicit.\n\nCalling synchronize_rcu() isn't ideal, but fixing this without is hard\nand way more intrusive.  As-is, we can get:\n\nWARNING: .. net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c:5515 nft_set_destroy+0x..\nWorkqueue: events nf_tables_trans_destroy_work\nRIP: 0010:nft_set_destroy+0x3fe/0x5c0\nCall Trace:\n <TASK>\n nf_tables_trans_destroy_work+0x6b7/0xad0\n process_one_work+0x64a/0xce0\n worker_thread+0x613/0x10d0\n\nIn case the synchronize_rcu becomes an issue, we can explore alternatives.\n\nOne way would be to allocate nft_trans_rule objects + one nft_trans_chain\nobject, deactivate the rules + the chain and then defer the freeing to the\nnft destroy workqueue.  We'd still need to keep the synchronize_rcu path as\na fallback to handle -ENOMEM corner cases though."
