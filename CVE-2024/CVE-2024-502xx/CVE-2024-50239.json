This bug\nwas later reproduced when the driver was copied to create the\nqmp-usb-legacy driver.\n\nRestore the driver data initialisation at probe to avoid a NULL-pointer\ndereference on runtime suspend.\n\nApparently no one uses runtime PM, which currently needs to be enabled\nmanually through sysfs, with these drivers."
