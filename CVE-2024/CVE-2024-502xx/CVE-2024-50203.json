      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf, arm64: Fix address emission with tag-based KASAN enabled\n\nWhen BPF_TRAMP_F_CALL_ORIG is enabled, the address of a bpf_tramp_image\nstruct on the stack is passed during the size calculation pass and\nan address on the heap is passed during code generation. This may\ncause a heap buffer overflow if the heap address is tagged because\nemit_a64_mov_i64() will emit longer code than it did during the size\ncalculation pass. The same problem could occur without tag-based\nKASAN if one of the 16-bit words of the stack address happened to\nbe all-ones during the size calculation pass. Fix the problem by\nassuming the worst case (4 instructions) when calculating the size\nof the bpf_tramp_image address emission."
