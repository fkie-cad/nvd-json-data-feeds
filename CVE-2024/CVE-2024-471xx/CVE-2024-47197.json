We expect that on many developer machines, this also contains\ncredentials.\n\nWhen the user runs mvn verify again (without a mvn clean), this file becomes part of\nthe final artifact.\n\nIf a developer were to publish this into Maven Central or any other remote repository (whether as a release\nor a snapshot) their credentials would be published without them knowing."
