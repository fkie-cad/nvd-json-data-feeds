As a fix the sentence displayed after resetting password no longer shows if the user exists or not. This fix is included in versions 2.7.11, 3.0.5, 3.1.2, and 3.2.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may overload the dictionary entry `\"UI:ResetPwd-Error-WrongLogin\"` through an extension and replace it with a generic message."
