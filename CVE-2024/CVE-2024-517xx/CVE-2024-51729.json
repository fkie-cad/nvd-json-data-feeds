      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm: use aligned address in copy_user_gigantic_page()\n\nIn current kernel, hugetlb_wp() calls copy_user_large_folio() with the\nfault address.  Where the fault address may be not aligned with the huge\npage size.  Then, copy_user_large_folio() may call\ncopy_user_gigantic_page() with the address, while\ncopy_user_gigantic_page() requires the address to be huge page size\naligned.  So, this may cause memory corruption or information leak,\naddtional, use more obvious naming 'addr_hint' instead of 'addr' for\ncopy_user_gigantic_page()."
