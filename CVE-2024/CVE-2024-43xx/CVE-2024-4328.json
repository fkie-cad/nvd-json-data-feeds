      "value": "A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in the clear_personality_files_list function of the parisneo/lollms-webui v9.6. The vulnerability arises from the use of a GET request to clear personality files list, which lacks proper CSRF protection. This flaw allows attackers to trick users into performing actions without their consent, such as deleting important files on the system. The issue is present in the application's handling of requests, making it susceptible to CSRF attacks that could lead to unauthorized actions being performed on behalf of the user."
