This only happened when the password was changed with CLI. The problem does not happen in case change was done with webserver thus this is different from\u00a0 CVE-2023-40273 https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pm87-24wq-r8w9 \u00a0which was addressed in Apache-Airflow 2.7.0\n\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 1.5.2, which fixes the issue."
