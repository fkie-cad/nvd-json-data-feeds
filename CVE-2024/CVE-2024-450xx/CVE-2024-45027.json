If it fails early enough, before xhci->interrupters\nis allocated but after xhci->max_interrupters has been set, which\nhappens in most (all?) cases, things get uglier, as xhci_mem_cleanup()\nunconditionally derefences xhci->interrupters. With prejudice.\n\nGate the interrupt freeing loop with a check on xhci->interrupters\nbeing non-NULL.\n\nFound while debugging a DMA allocation issue that led the XHCI driver\non this exact path."
