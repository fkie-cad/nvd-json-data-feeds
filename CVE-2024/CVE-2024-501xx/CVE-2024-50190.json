      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nice: fix memleak in ice_init_tx_topology()\n\nFix leak of the FW blob (DDP pkg).\n\nMake ice_cfg_tx_topo() const-correct, so ice_init_tx_topology() can avoid\ncopying whole FW blob. Copy just the topology section, and only when\nneeded. Reuse the buffer allocated for the read of the current topology.\n\nThis was found by kmemleak, with the following trace for each PF:\n    [<ffffffff8761044d>] kmemdup_noprof+0x1d/0x50\n    [<ffffffffc0a0a480>] ice_init_ddp_config+0x100/0x220 [ice]\n    [<ffffffffc0a0da7f>] ice_init_dev+0x6f/0x200 [ice]\n    [<ffffffffc0a0dc49>] ice_init+0x29/0x560 [ice]\n    [<ffffffffc0a10c1d>] ice_probe+0x21d/0x310 [ice]\n\nConstify ice_cfg_tx_topo() @buf parameter.\nThis cascades further down to few more functions."
