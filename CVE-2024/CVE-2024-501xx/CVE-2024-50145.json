      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nocteon_ep: Add SKB allocation failures handling in __octep_oq_process_rx()\n\nbuild_skb() returns NULL in case of a memory allocation failure so handle\nit inside __octep_oq_process_rx() to avoid NULL pointer dereference.\n\n__octep_oq_process_rx() is called during NAPI polling by the driver. If\nskb allocation fails, keep on pulling packets out of the Rx DMA queue: we\nshouldn't break the polling immediately and thus falsely indicate to the\noctep_napi_poll() that the Rx pressure is going down. As there is no\nassociated skb in this case, don't process the packets and don't push them\nup the network stack - they are skipped.\n\nHelper function is implemented to unmmap/flush all the fragment buffers\nused by the dropped packet. 'alloc_failures' counter is incremented to\nmark the skb allocation error in driver statistics.\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE."
