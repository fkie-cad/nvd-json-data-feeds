The current\nimplementation leads to a segmentation fault on every attempt to read\nthe attribute because indio_dev gets a NULL assignment.\n\nThis bug has been present since the first appearance of the driver,\napparently since the last version (V6) before getting applied. A\nconstant attribute was used until then, and the last modifications might\nhave not been tested again."
