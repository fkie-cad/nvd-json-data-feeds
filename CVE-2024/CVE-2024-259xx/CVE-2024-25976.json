      "value": "When LDAP authentication is activated in the configuration it is possible to obtain reflected XSS execution by creating a custom URL that the victim only needs to open in order to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This is due to a fault in the file login.php where the content of \"$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']\" is reflected into the HTML of the website. Hence the attacker does not need a valid account in order to exploit this issue."
