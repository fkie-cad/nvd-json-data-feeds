      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/nouveau: fix several DMA buffer leaks\n\nNouveau manages GSP-RM DMA buffers with nvkm_gsp_mem objects.  Several of\nthese buffers are never dealloced.  Some of them can be deallocated\nright after GSP-RM is initialized, but the rest need to stay until the\ndriver unloads.\n\nAlso futher bullet-proof these objects by poisoning the buffer and\nclearing the nvkm_gsp_mem object when it is deallocated.  Poisoning\nthe buffer should trigger an error (or crash) from GSP-RM if it tries\nto access the buffer after we've deallocated it, because we were wrong\nabout when it is safe to deallocate.\n\nFinally, change the mem->size field to a size_t because that's the same\ntype that dma_alloc_coherent expects."
