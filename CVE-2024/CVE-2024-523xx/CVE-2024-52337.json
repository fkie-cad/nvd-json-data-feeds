      "value": "A log spoofing flaw was found in the Tuned package due to improper sanitization of some API arguments. This flaw allows an attacker to pass a controlled sequence of characters; newlines can be inserted into the log. Instead of the 'evil' the attacker could mimic a valid TuneD log line and trick the administrator. The quotes '' are usually used in TuneD logs citing raw user input, so there will always be the ' character ending the spoofed input, and the administrator can easily overlook this. This logged string is later used in logging and in the output of utilities, for example, `tuned-adm get_instances` or other third-party programs that use Tuned's D-Bus interface for such operations."
