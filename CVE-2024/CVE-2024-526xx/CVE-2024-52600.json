      "value": "Statmatic is a Laravel and Git powered content management system (CMS). Prior to version 5.17.0, assets uploaded with appropriately crafted filenames may result in them being placed in a location different than what was configured. The issue affects front-end forms with `assets` fields and other places where assets can be uploaded, although users would need upload permissions anyway. Files can be uploaded so they would be located on the server in a different location, and potentially override existing files. Traversal outside an asset container is not possible. This path traversal vulnerability has been fixed in 5.17.0."
