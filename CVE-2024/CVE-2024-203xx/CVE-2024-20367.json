      "value": "A vulnerability in the web UI of Cisco Enterprise Chat and Email (ECE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface.\r\n\r This vulnerability exists because the web UI does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid agent credentials."
