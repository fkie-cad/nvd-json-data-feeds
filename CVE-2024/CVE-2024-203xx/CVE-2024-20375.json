An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SIP message to an affected Cisco Unified CM or Cisco Unified CM SME device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition that interrupts the communications of reliant voice and video devices."
