      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/vmwgfx: Disable coherent dumb buffers without 3d\n\nCoherent surfaces make only sense if the host renders to them using\naccelerated apis. Without 3d the entire content of dumb buffers stays\nin the guest making all of the extra work they're doing to synchronize\nbetween guest and host useless.\n\nConfigurations without 3d also tend to run with very low graphics\nmemory limits. The pinned console fb, mob cursors and graphical login\nmanager tend to run out of 16MB graphics memory that those guests use.\n\nFix it by making sure the coherent dumb buffers are only used on\nconfigs with 3d enabled."
