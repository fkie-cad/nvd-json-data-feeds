      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nxen: privcmd: Fix possible access to a freed kirqfd instance\n\nNothing prevents simultaneous ioctl calls to privcmd_irqfd_assign() and\nprivcmd_irqfd_deassign(). If that happens, it is possible that a kirqfd\ncreated and added to the irqfds_list by privcmd_irqfd_assign() may get\nremoved by another thread executing privcmd_irqfd_deassign(), while the\nformer is still using it after dropping the locks.\n\nThis can lead to a situation where an already freed kirqfd instance may\nbe accessed and cause kernel oops.\n\nUse SRCU locking to prevent the same, as is done for the KVM\nimplementation for irqfds."
