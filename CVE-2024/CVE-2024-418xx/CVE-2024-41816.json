The Cooked plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via the \u2018[cooked-timer]\u2019 shortcode in versions up to, and including, 1.8.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This vulnerability allows authenticated attackers with subscriber-level access and above to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses a compromised page. This issue has been addressed in release version 1.8.1. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."
