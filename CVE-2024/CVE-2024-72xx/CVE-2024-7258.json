      "value": "The WooCommerce Google Feed Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized loss of data due to a missing capability check on the 'wppfm_removeFeedFile' function in all versions up to, and including, 2.8.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php)."
