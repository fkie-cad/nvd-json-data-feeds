      "value": "A vulnerability in a logging function of Cisco Nexus Dashboard Insights could allow an attacker with access to a tech support file to view sensitive information.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because remote controller credentials are recorded in an internal log that is stored in the tech support file. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing a tech support file that is generated from an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view remote controller admin credentials in clear text.\r\nNote: Best practice is to store debug logs and tech support files safely and to share them only with trusted parties because they may contain sensitive information."
