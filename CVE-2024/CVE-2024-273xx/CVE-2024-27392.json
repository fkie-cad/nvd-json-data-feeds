      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnvme: host: fix double-free of struct nvme_id_ns in ns_update_nuse()\n\nWhen nvme_identify_ns() fails, it frees the pointer to the struct\nnvme_id_ns before it returns. However, ns_update_nuse() calls kfree()\nfor the pointer even when nvme_identify_ns() fails. This results in\nKASAN double-free, which was observed with blktests nvme/045 with\nproposed patches [1] on the kernel v6.8-rc7. Fix the double-free by\nskipping kfree() when nvme_identify_ns() fails."
