      "value": "Canarytokens help track activity and actions on a network.  A Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability was identified in the \"Cloned Website\" Canarytoken, whereby the Canarytoken's creator can attack themselves. The creator of a slow-redirect Canarytoken can insert Javascript into the destination URL of their slow redirect token. When the creator later browses the management page for their own Canarytoken, the Javascript executes. This is a self-XSS. An attacker could create a Canarytoken with this self-XSS, and send the management link to a victim. When they click on it, the Javascript would execute. However, no sensitive information (ex. session information) will be disclosed to the malicious actor. This issue is now patched on Canarytokens.org. Users of self-hosted Canarytokens installations can update by pulling the latest Docker image, or any Docker image after `sha-097d91a`."
