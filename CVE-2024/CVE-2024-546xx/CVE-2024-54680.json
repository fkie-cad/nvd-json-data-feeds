      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsmb: client: fix TCP timers deadlock after rmmod\n\nCommit ef7134c7fc48 (\"smb: client: Fix use-after-free of network namespace.\")\nfixed a netns UAF by manually enabled socket refcounting\n(sk->sk_net_refcnt=1 and sock_inuse_add(net, 1)).\n\nThe reason the patch worked for that bug was because we now hold\nreferences to the netns (get_net_track() gets a ref internally)\nand they're properly released (internally, on __sk_destruct()),\nbut only because sk->sk_net_refcnt was set.\n\nProblem:\n(this happens regardless of CONFIG_NET_NS_REFCNT_TRACKER and regardless\nif init_net or other)\n\nSetting sk->sk_net_refcnt=1 *manually* and *after* socket creation is not\nonly out of cifs scope, but also technically wrong -- it's set conditionally\nbased on user (=1) vs kernel (=0) sockets.  And net/ implementations\nseem to base their user vs kernel space operations on it.\n\ne.g. upon TCP socket close, the TCP timers are not cleared because\nsk->sk_net_refcnt=1:\n(cf. commit 151c9c724d05 (\"tcp: properly terminate timers for kernel sockets\"))\n\nnet/ipv4/tcp.c:\n    void tcp_close(struct sock *sk, long timeout)\n    {\n    \tlock_sock(sk);\n    \t__tcp_close(sk, timeout);\n    \trelease_sock(sk);\n    \tif (!sk->sk_net_refcnt)\n    \t\tinet_csk_clear_xmit_timers_sync(sk);\n    \tsock_put(sk);\n    }\n\nWhich will throw a lockdep warning and then, as expected, deadlock on\ntcp_write_timer().\n\nA way to reproduce this is by running the reproducer from ef7134c7fc48\nand then 'rmmod cifs'.  A few seconds later, the deadlock/lockdep\nwarning shows up.\n\nFix:\nWe shouldn't mess with socket internals ourselves, so do not set\nsk_net_refcnt manually.\n\nAlso change __sock_create() to sock_create_kern() for explicitness.\n\nAs for non-init_net network namespaces, we deal with it the best way\nwe can -- hold an extra netns reference for server->ssocket and drop it\nwhen it's released.  This ensures that the netns still exists whenever\nwe need to create/destroy server->ssocket, but is not directly tied to\nit."
