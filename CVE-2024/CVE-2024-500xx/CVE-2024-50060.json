      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nio_uring: check if we need to reschedule during overflow flush\n\nIn terms of normal application usage, this list will always be empty.\nAnd if an application does overflow a bit, it'll have a few entries.\nHowever, nothing obviously prevents syzbot from running a test case\nthat generates a ton of overflow entries, and then flushing them can\ntake quite a while.\n\nCheck for needing to reschedule while flushing, and drop our locks and\ndo so if necessary. There's no state to maintain here as overflows\nalways prune from head-of-list, hence it's fine to drop and reacquire\nthe locks at the end of the loop."
