      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsfc: Don't invoke xdp_do_flush() from netpoll.\n\nYury reported a crash in the sfc driver originated from\nnetpoll_send_udp(). The netconsole sends a message and then netpoll\ninvokes the driver's NAPI function with a budget of zero. It is\ndedicated to allow driver to free TX resources, that it may have used\nwhile sending the packet.\n\nIn the netpoll case the driver invokes xdp_do_flush() unconditionally,\nleading to crash because bpf_net_context was never assigned.\n\nInvoke xdp_do_flush() only if budget is not zero."
