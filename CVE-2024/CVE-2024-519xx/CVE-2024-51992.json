      "value": "Orchid is a @laravel package that allows for rapid application development of back-office applications, admin/user panels, and dashboards. This vulnerability is a method exposure issue (CWE-749: Exposed Dangerous Method or Function) in the Orchid Platform\u2019s asynchronous modal functionality, affecting users of Orchid Platform version 8 through 14.42.x. Attackers could exploit this vulnerability to call arbitrary methods within the `Screen` class, leading to potential brute force of database tables, validation checks against user credentials, and disclosure of the server\u2019s real IP address. The issue has been patched in the latest release, version 14.43.0, released on November 6, 2024. Users should upgrade to version 14.43.0 or later to address this vulnerability. If upgrading to version 14.43.0 is not immediately possible, users can mitigate the vulnerability by implementing middleware to intercept and validate requests to asynchronous modal endpoints, allowing only approved methods and parameters."
