      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nerofs: handle overlapped pclusters out of crafted images properly\n\nsyzbot reported a task hang issue due to a deadlock case where it is\nwaiting for the folio lock of a cached folio that will be used for\ncache I/Os.\n\nAfter looking into the crafted fuzzed image, I found it's formed with\nseveral overlapped big pclusters as below:\n\n Ext:   logical offset   |  length :     physical offset    |  length\n   0:        0..   16384 |   16384 :     151552..    167936 |   16384\n   1:    16384..   32768 |   16384 :     155648..    172032 |   16384\n   2:    32768..   49152 |   16384 :  537223168.. 537239552 |   16384\n...\n\nHere, extent 0/1 are physically overlapped although it's entirely\n_impossible_ for normal filesystem images generated by mkfs.\n\nFirst, managed folios containing compressed data will be marked as\nup-to-date and then unlocked immediately (unlike in-place folios) when\ncompressed I/Os are complete.  If physical blocks are not submitted in\nthe incremental order, there should be separate BIOs to avoid dependency\nissues.  However, the current code mis-arranges z_erofs_fill_bio_vec()\nand BIO submission which causes unexpected BIO waits.\n\nSecond, managed folios will be connected to their own pclusters for\nefficient inter-queries.  However, this is somewhat hard to implement\neasily if overlapped big pclusters exist.  Again, these only appear in\nfuzzed images so let's simply fall back to temporary short-lived pages\nfor correctness.\n\nAdditionally, it justifies that referenced managed folios cannot be\ntruncated for now and reverts part of commit 2080ca1ed3e4 (\"erofs: tidy\nup `struct z_erofs_bvec`\") for simplicity although it shouldn't be any\ndifference."
