      "value": "The Admin and Site Enhancements (ASE) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via SVG File uploads in all versions up to, and including, 7.5.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with custom-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the SVG file. This feature must be enabled, and for specific roles in order to be exploitable."
