Users that get site admin but not a system admin, should not have access to the System Maintenance \u2192 Tools portlet. This would share database username and password under Log Files and download DB Dump and other dotCMS Content under Tools. Nothing in the System \u2192 Maintenance should be displayed for users with site admin role.
