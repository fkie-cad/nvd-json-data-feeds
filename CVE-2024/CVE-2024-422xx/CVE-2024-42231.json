      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: zoned: fix calc_available_free_space() for zoned mode\n\ncalc_available_free_space() returns the total size of metadata (or\nsystem) block groups, which can be allocated from unallocated disk\nspace. The logic is wrong on zoned mode in two places.\n\nFirst, the calculation of data_chunk_size is wrong. We always allocate\none zone as one chunk, and no partial allocation of a zone. So, we\nshould use zone_size (= data_sinfo->chunk_size) as it is.\n\nSecond, the result \"avail\" may not be zone aligned. Since we always\nallocate one zone as one chunk on zoned mode, returning non-zone size\naligned bytes will result in less pressure on the async metadata reclaim\nprocess.\n\nThis is serious for the nearly full state with a large zone size device.\nAllowing over-commit too much will result in less async reclaim work and\nend up in ENOSPC. We can align down to the zone size to avoid that."
