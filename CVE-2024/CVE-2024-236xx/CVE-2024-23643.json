A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in versions prior to 2.23.2 and 2.24.1 that enables an authenticated administrator with workspace-level privileges to store a JavaScript payload in the GeoServer catalog that will execute in the context of another administrator\u2019s browser when viewed in the GWC Seed Form. Access to the GWC Seed Form is limited to full administrators by default and granting non-administrators access to this endpoint is not recommended. Versions 2.23.2 and 2.24.1 contain a fix for this issue."
