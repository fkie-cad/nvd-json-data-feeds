      "value": "This vulnerability exists in Digisol Router (DG-GR1321: Hardware version 3.7L;  Firmware version : v3.2.02) due to presence of root terminal access on a serial interface without proper access control. An\u00a0attacker\u00a0with\u00a0physical\u00a0access\u00a0could exploit this by identifying UART pins and accessing the root shell on the vulnerable system.\n\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow the attacker to access the sensitive information on the targeted system.This vulnerability exists in Digisol Router (DG-GR1321: Hardware version 3.7L;  Firmware version : v3.2.02) due to lack of encryption or hashing in storing of passwords within the router's firmware/ database. An\u00a0attacker\u00a0with\u00a0physical\u00a0access\u00a0could exploit this by extracting the firmware and reverse engineer the binary data to access the plaintext passwords on the vulnerable system.\n\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the targeted system."
