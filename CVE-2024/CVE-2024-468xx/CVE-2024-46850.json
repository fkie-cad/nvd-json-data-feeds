      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amd/display: Avoid race between dcn35_set_drr() and dc_state_destruct()\n\ndc_state_destruct() nulls the resource context of the DC state. The pipe\ncontext passed to dcn35_set_drr() is a member of this resource context.\n\nIf dc_state_destruct() is called parallel to the IRQ processing (which\ncalls dcn35_set_drr() at some point), we can end up using already nulled\nfunction callback fields of struct stream_resource.\n\nThe logic in dcn35_set_drr() already tries to avoid this, by checking tg\nagainst NULL. But if the nulling happens exactly after the NULL check and\nbefore the next access, then we get a race.\n\nAvoid this by copying tg first to a local variable, and then use this\nvariable for all the operations. This should work, as long as nobody\nfrees the resource pool where the timing generators live.\n\n(cherry picked from commit 0607a50c004798a96e62c089a4c34c220179dcb5)"
