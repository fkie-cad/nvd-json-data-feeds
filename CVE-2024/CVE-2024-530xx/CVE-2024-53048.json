      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nice: fix crash on probe for DPLL enabled E810 LOM\n\nThe E810 Lan On Motherboard (LOM) design is vendor specific. Intel\nprovides the reference design, but it is up to vendor on the final\nproduct design. For some cases, like Linux DPLL support, the static\nvalues defined in the driver does not reflect the actual LOM design.\nCurrent implementation of dpll pins is causing the crash on probe\nof the ice driver for such DPLL enabled E810 LOM designs:\n\nWARNING: (...) at drivers/dpll/dpll_core.c:495 dpll_pin_get+0x2c4/0x330\n...\nCall Trace:\n <TASK>\n ? __warn+0x83/0x130\n ? dpll_pin_get+0x2c4/0x330\n ? report_bug+0x1b7/0x1d0\n ? handle_bug+0x42/0x70\n ? exc_invalid_op+0x18/0x70\n ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x1a/0x20\n ? dpll_pin_get+0x117/0x330\n ? dpll_pin_get+0x2c4/0x330\n ? dpll_pin_get+0x117/0x330\n ice_dpll_get_pins.isra.0+0x52/0xe0 [ice]\n...\n\nThe number of dpll pins enabled by LOM vendor is greater than expected\nand defined in the driver for Intel designed NICs, which causes the crash.\n\nPrevent the crash and allow generic pin initialization within Linux DPLL\nsubsystem for DPLL enabled E810 LOM designs.\n\nNewly designed solution for described issue will be based on \"per HW\ndesign\" pin initialization. It requires pin information dynamically\nacquired from the firmware and is already in progress, planned for\nnext-tree only."
