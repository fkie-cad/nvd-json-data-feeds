The recent bug report gives also evidence of\nthis behaviour.\n\nAadress this by locking the TPM chip before checking any chip->flags both\nin tpm_pm_suspend() and tpm_hwrng_read(). Move TPM_CHIP_FLAG_SUSPENDED\ncheck inside tpm_get_random() so that it will be always checked only when\nthe lock is reserved."
