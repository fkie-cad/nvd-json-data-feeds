      "value": "A reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the login page of IceHRM v32.4.0.OS. The vulnerability is due to improper sanitization of the \"next\" parameter, which is included in the application's response without adequate escaping. An attacker can exploit this flaw by tricking a user into visiting a specially crafted URL, causing the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. The issue occurs even though the application has sanitization mechanisms in place."
