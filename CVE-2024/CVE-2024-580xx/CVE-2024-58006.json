      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nPCI: dwc: ep: Prevent changing BAR size/flags in pci_epc_set_bar()\n\nIn commit 4284c88fff0e (\"PCI: designware-ep: Allow pci_epc_set_bar() update\ninbound map address\") set_bar() was modified to support dynamically\nchanging the backing physical address of a BAR that was already configured.\n\nThis means that set_bar() can be called twice, without ever calling\nclear_bar() (as calling clear_bar() would clear the BAR's PCI address\nassigned by the host).\n\nThis can only be done if the new BAR size/flags does not differ from the\nexisting BAR configuration. Add these missing checks.\n\nIf we allow set_bar() to set e.g. a new BAR size that differs from the\nexisting BAR size, the new address translation range will be smaller than\nthe BAR size already determined by the host, which would mean that a read\npast the new BAR size would pass the iATU untranslated, which could allow\nthe host to read memory not belonging to the new struct pci_epf_bar.\n\nWhile at it, add comments which clarifies the support for dynamically\nchanging the physical address of a BAR. (Which was also missing.)"
