      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nBluetooth: L2CAP: handle NULL sock pointer in l2cap_sock_alloc\n\nA NULL sock pointer is passed into l2cap_sock_alloc() when it is called\nfrom l2cap_sock_new_connection_cb() and the error handling paths should\nalso be aware of it.\n\nSeemingly a more elegant solution would be to swap bt_sock_alloc() and\nl2cap_chan_create() calls since they are not interdependent to that moment\nbut then l2cap_chan_create() adds the soon to be deallocated and still\ndummy-initialized channel to the global list accessible by many L2CAP\npaths. The channel would be removed from the list in short period of time\nbut be a bit more straight-forward here and just check for NULL instead of\nchanging the order of function calls.\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE static\nanalysis tool."
