Prior to version 3.2.3 on the `stable` branch and version 3.3.0.beta3 on the `tests-passed` branch, an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript on users\u2019 browsers by posting a specific URL containing maliciously crafted meta tags. This issue only affects sites with Content Security Polic (CSP) disabled. The problem has been patched in version 3.2.3 on the `stable` branch and version 3.3.0.beta3 on the `tests-passed` branch. As a workaround, ensure CSP is enabled on the forum."
