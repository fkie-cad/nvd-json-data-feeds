      "value": "The MultiPurpose theme for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.0 via deserialization of untrusted input through the 'wpeden_post_meta' post meta. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code."
