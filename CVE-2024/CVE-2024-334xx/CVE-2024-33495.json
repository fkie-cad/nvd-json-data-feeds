The affected application does not properly limit the size of specific logs. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to exhaust system resources by creating a great number of log entries which could potentially lead to a denial of service condition. A successful exploitation requires the attacker to have access to specific SIMATIC RTLS Locating Manager Clients in the deployment."
