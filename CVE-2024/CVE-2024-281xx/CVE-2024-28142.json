      "lang": "en",
      "value": "Due to missing input sanitization, an attacker can perform cross-site-scripting attacks and run arbitrary Javascript in the browser of other users. The \"File Name\" page (/cgi/uset.cgi?-cfilename) in the User Settings menu improperly filters the \"file name\" and wildcard character input field. By exploiting the wildcard character feature, attackers are able to store arbitrary Javascript code which is being triggered if the page is viewed afterwards, e.g. by higher privileged users such as admins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis attack can even be performed without being logged in because the affected functions are not fully protected. Without logging in, only the file name parameter of the \"Default\" User can be changed."
