      "value": "The Awesome Support \u2013 WordPress HelpDesk & Support Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to union-based SQL Injection via the 'q' parameter of the wpas_get_users action in all versions up to, and including, 6.1.7 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database."
