      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nio_uring: check if iowq is killed before queuing\n\ntask work can be executed after the task has gone through io_uring\ntermination, whether it's the final task_work run or the fallback path.\nIn this case, task work will find ->io_wq being already killed and\nnull'ed, which is a problem if it then tries to forward the request to\nio_queue_iowq(). Make io_queue_iowq() fail requests in this case.\n\nNote that it also checks PF_KTHREAD, because the user can first close\na DEFER_TASKRUN ring and shortly after kill the task, in which case\n->iowq check would race."
