      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nquota: flush quota_release_work upon quota writeback\n\nOne of the paths quota writeback is called from is:\n\nfreeze_super()\n  sync_filesystem()\n    ext4_sync_fs()\n      dquot_writeback_dquots()\n\nSince we currently don't always flush the quota_release_work queue in\nthis path, we can end up with the following race:\n\n 1. dquot are added to releasing_dquots list during regular operations.\n 2. FS Freeze starts, however, this does not flush the quota_release_work queue.\n 3. Freeze completes.\n 4. Kernel eventually tries to flush the workqueue while FS is frozen which\n    hits a WARN_ON since transaction gets started during frozen state:\n\n  ext4_journal_check_start+0x28/0x110 [ext4] (unreliable)\n  __ext4_journal_start_sb+0x64/0x1c0 [ext4]\n  ext4_release_dquot+0x90/0x1d0 [ext4]\n  quota_release_workfn+0x43c/0x4d0\n\nWhich is the following line:\n\n  WARN_ON(sb->s_writers.frozen == SB_FREEZE_COMPLETE);\n\nWhich ultimately results in generic/390 failing due to dmesg\nnoise. This was detected on powerpc machine 15 cores.\n\nTo avoid this, make sure to flush the workqueue during\ndquot_writeback_dquots() so we dont have any pending workitems after\nfreeze."
