      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnfs/localio: must clear res.replen in nfs_local_read_done\n\nOtherwise memory corruption can occur due to NFSv3 LOCALIO reads\nleaving garbage in res.replen:\n- nfs3_read_done() copies that into server->read_hdrsize; from there\n  nfs3_proc_read_setup() copies it to args.replen in new requests.\n- nfs3_xdr_enc_read3args() passes that to rpc_prepare_reply_pages()\n  which includes it in hdrsize for xdr_init_pages, so that rq_rcv_buf\n  contains a ridiculous len.\n- This is copied to rq_private_buf and xs_read_stream_request()\n  eventually passes the kvec to sock_recvmsg() which receives incoming\n  data into entirely the wrong place.\n\nThis is easily reproduced with NFSv3 LOCALIO that is servicing reads\nwhen it is made to pivot back to using normal RPC.  This switch back\nto using normal NFSv3 with RPC can occur for a few reasons but this\nissue was exposed with a test that stops and then restarts the NFSv3\nserver while LOCALIO is performing heavy read IO."
