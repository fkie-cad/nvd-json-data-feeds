      "value": "A vulnerability in Veeam Backup & Replication allows a low-privileged user with certain roles to perform remote code execution (RCE) by updating existing jobs. These jobs can be configured to run pre- and post-scripts, which can be located on a network share and are executed with elevated privileges by default. The user can update a job and schedule it to run almost immediately, allowing arbitrary code execution on the server."
