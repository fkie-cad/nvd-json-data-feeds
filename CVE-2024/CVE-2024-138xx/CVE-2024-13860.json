      "value": "The Buddyboss Platform plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the \u2018bbp_topic_title\u2019 parameter in all versions up to, and including, 2.8.50 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. The vulnerability was partially patched in version 2.8.41."
